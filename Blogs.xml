<p>We decide the Borel complexity of the conjugacy problem for automorphism groups of countable homogeneous digraphs. Many of the homogeneous digraphs, as well as several other homogeneous structures, have already been addressed in previous articles (<a href="http://boolesrings.org/scoskey/summer/">here</a> and <a href="http://boolesrings.org/scoskey/conjugacy/">here</a>). In this article we complete the program, and establish a dichotomy theorem that this complexity is either the minimum or the maximum among relations which are classifiable by countable structures. We also discuss the possibility of extending our results beyond graphs to more general classes of countable homogeneous structures.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This semester I am in charge of organizing our <a href="http://naumathstat.github.io/seminars/famus/">Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar</a> (FAMUS).  As the title suggests, the seminar is aimed at undergraduates and happens on Friday afternoons.  You might be surprised to hear that we usually pack the room every week...on Friday afternoons!!!  Typically the first half (30 minutes) of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half.</p>

<p>I usually give a couple talks in FAMUS each semester, but this year I&#39;m also responsible for all the logistics while the usual host (Jeff Rushall) is on sabbatical in Portugal.</p>

<p>Yesterday kicked off the first FAMUS of the semester and we had close to 60 students and faculty in attendance.  It was definitely the biggest turnout that I&#39;ve seen at FAMUS.  Hopefully, we keep them coming.  The talk was given by me and the topic was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox">Friendship Paradox</a>.  The idea for the talk was inspired by <a href="https://plus.google.com/101584889282878921052/posts/cHo5dMTQdsW">a post by Richard Green</a> on Google+.  Richard has lots of great posts on Google+ on a variety of mathematical topics and I&#39;ll definitely be mining his posts for more ideas for talks.</p>

<p>The official title of the talk was &quot;The Friendship Paradox: Your friends, on average, have more friends than you do&quot; and here is the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Friendship Paradox is the observation that your friends, on average, have more friends than you do. This phenomenon, which was first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991, is mathematically provable. In this episode of FAMUS, we will discuss the &quot;paradox&quot;, sketch its proof, and explore some applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the slides for the talk:</p>

<p>A lot of the content of my slides came directly from the article <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/friends-you-can-count-on/">Friends You Can Count On</a> by <a href="http://www.stevenstrogatz.com">Stephen Strogatz</a> at NY Times Opinator.  I also relied on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox">Wikipedia article on the Friendship Paradox</a>, which contains a sketch of the proof of the paradox. I also took some ideas and used a figure from the article <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03022">The Majority Illusion in Social Networks</a> by Lerman, Yan, Wu.</p>

<p>The faculty guest this week was <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jmn3/">John Neuberger</a>.  I really enjoyed interviewing John and I think the audience found it pretty entertaining.</p>]]></summary>

<p>One of the intriguing lessons of the past half-century of set theory is that there is a robust connection between infinitary game theory and fundamental set-theoretic principles, including the existence of certain large cardinals, and the existence of strategies in infinite games has often turned out to have an unexpected set-theoretic power. In this article, we should like to exhibit another such connection in the case of games of proper class size, by proving that the principle of clopen determinacy for class games is exactly equivalent to the principle of transfinite recursion along well-founded class relations. Since this principle implies ${\rm Con}({\rm ZFC})$ and iterated instances of ${\rm Con}^\alpha({\rm ZFC})$ and more, the principles of open determinacy and clopen determinacy both transcend ${\rm ZFC}$ in consistency strength.</p>
<p>We consider two-player games of perfect information, where two players alternately play elements from an allowed space $X$ of possible moves, which in our case may be a proper class such as the class of all ordinals $X={\rm Ord}$. Together, the players build an infinite sequence $\vec\alpha=\langle \alpha_0,\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots\rangle$ in $X^\omega$, which is the play resulting from this particular instance of the game. The winner of this play is determined by consulting a fixed class of plays $A\subseteq X^\omega$, possibly a proper class: if $\vec\alpha\in A$, then the first player has won this particular instance of the game, and otherwise the second player has won. A strategy for a player is a (class) function $\sigma:X^{\lt\omega}\to X$, which tells a player how to move next, given a finite position in the game. Such a strategy is winning for that player, if following the instructions of the strategy leads to a winning play of the game, regardless of how the other player has moved. The game is determined, if one of the players has a winning strategy. We may formalize all talk of classes here in GÃ¶del-Bernays ${\rm GBC}$ set theory, or in ${\rm ZFC}$ if one prefers to regard classes as definable from parameters.</p>
<p>The case of open games, generalizing the finite games, is an attractive special case, which for set-sized games has been useful in many arguments. Specifically, a game is <em>open</em> for a particular player, if for every winning play of the game for that player, there occurred during the course of play a finite position where the winning outcome was already ensured, in the sense that all plays extending that position are winning for that player. This is equivalent to saying that the winning condition set for that player is open in the product topology on $X^\omega$, where we put the discrete topology on $X$. Similarly, a game is <em>clopen</em>, if it is open for each player; these are the games for which every play of the game has a finite stage where the outcome is already known.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable elementary fact, the Gale-Stewart theorem [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_4">1</a>], that in the context of set-sized games, every open game is determined. An elegant proof of open determinacy can be undertaken using the theory of ordinal game values. (For an accessible discussion of ordinal game values, using infinite chess amongst other games as illustration, please see the second author&#8217;s article [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_5">2</a>].) Suppose that we have a game that is open for player I, with open winning condition $A\subseteq X^\omega$, where $X$ is the <em>set</em> of possible moves. Consider the collection of positions that arise in this game at a finite stage of the game. Such a position $p$ is said to have value $0$, if player I has essentially already won by achieving that position, in the sense that every play extending $p$ is in $A$; in other words, the entire basic open neighborhood of $p$ is contained in the open set $A$. A position $q$ with player I to play has value $1$, if it isn&#8217;t yet winning in that sense, but player I can make a move to $q^\smallfrown x$ so as to have value $0$. These game values measure the distance, in a sense, to a win for player I. Continuing recursively, define that a position $p$ with player I to play has value $\alpha+1$, if $\alpha$ is minimal such that player I can play to a position $p^\smallfrown x$ with value $\alpha$. Finally, the value of a position $p$ with player II to play is defined only when every position $p^\smallfrown y$ that player II can reach already has a value, and in this case the value of $p$ is the supremum of those values. There are two key observations to make. First, if a position has a value, then on his turns player I can play so as to decrease this value and player II cannot play so as to increase it or make it become undefined; thus, by means of this value-reducing strategy, the first player can ensure that eventually the value will become zero, since there is no infinite descending sequence of ordinals, and so this strategy is winning for player I. Second, if a position does not have a defined value, then player I cannot play so as to give it a value and player II can play so as to maintain the fact that it is unvalued; thus, by means of this maintaining strategy, the second player can ensure that a position with value zero is never reached, and so this strategy is winning for player II. Thus, we have proved the Gale-Stewart theorem: every open game is determined.</p>
<p>The reader should observe that this proof of open determinacy relied on the space $X$ of possible moves being a set, because when defining the value function of a position where it was player II&#8217;s turn, we took a supremum over the ordinal values of the positions arising from the possible moves, and if $X$ were a proper class, we couldn&#8217;t necessarily be sure to stay within the class of ordinals with this supremum. With a proper class $X$, the recursive procedure might break down, and it would seem that we could be pushed to consider class well-orderings having an order-type taller than ${\rm Ord}$. What we should like to do in this article, therefore, is consider more seriously the case where $X$ is a proper class. In this case, the strategies $\sigma:X^{\lt\omega}\to X$ will also be proper classes, and the winning condition $A\subseteq X^\omega$ may also be a proper class.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can we prove open determinacy for class games?</p>
<p>For example, does every definable open class game in ${\rm ZFC}$ admit a definable winning strategy for one of the players? In ${\rm GBC}$, must every open class game have a winning strategy?</p>
<p>We shall prove that the answers to both of these questions is no. The basic reason, established by Theorem 1, is that open determinacy implies ${\rm Con}({\rm ZFC})$ and much more. Thus, the principle of open determinacy and even of clopen determinacy goes strictly beyond the strength of ${\rm ZFC}$ and ${\rm GBC}$, if these are consistent. This result is generalized and clarified by Theorem 2, which shows that the principle of clopen determinacy is exactly equivalent over ${\rm GBC}$ to the principle of transfinite recursion over well-founded class relations. After this, we shall prove in Theorem 3 that open determinacy is provable in Kelley-Morse set theory ${\rm KM}$, and even in the theory ${\rm GBC}+\Pi^1_1$-comprehension, which is a proper fragment of ${\rm KM}$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>: The principle of clopen determinacy for class games implies ${\rm Con}({\rm ZFC})$, as well as iterated consistency assertions ${\rm Con}^\alpha({\rm ZFC})$ and more. Specifically, there is a definable clopen game, whose determinacy is equivalent over ${\rm GBC}$ to the existence of a satisfaction class for first-order truth.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong>: In GÃ¶del-Bernays set theory ${\rm GBC}$, the following are equivalent.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: -20px;";>
<li>
Clopen determinacy for class games.
</li>
<li>
The principle of first-order transfinite recursion over well-founded class relations: every such recursion has a solution.
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Theorem 3</strong>: Kelley-Morse set theory ${\rm KM}$ proves the principle of open determinacy for class games. Indeed, this conclusion is provable in the subtheory consisting of ${\rm GBC}$ plus $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension.</p>

        <updated>2015-09-04T21:46:48Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who peruses mathematical Q&#038;A sites, or had students come to office hours or send questions via other means (email, designated forums, carrier pigeons, or written on a note tied to a brick tossed into your office) knows the following statement: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where to begin&#8221;, or at least one of its variants.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman, who was this awesome guy who did a lot of cool things (and also some physics (but I won&#8217;t hold it against him today)), has a famous three-steps algorithm for solving any problem.</p>
<ol>
<li> Write the problem down.</li>
<li> Think. <em>Real</em>. Hard.</li>
<li> Write the solution down.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Feynman&#8217;s algorithm is quite simplistic, it really hits the nail on the head. But still, we seem to fail in solving a lot of our problems. Young students especially. Most of them might argue that the second step is really difficult, unless your name starts with Richard and ends with Feynman. While that&#8217;s not entirely wrong, what most people miss most of the time is the first step.</p>
<p>Writing the problem down does not mean just writing down the actual question as given to you in the exercise sheet, or writing the theorem that you wish to prove. It means that you have to unwind the definitions, and unwind exactly what you have to verify, until you hit a sufficiently strong bedrock of understanding.</p>
<p>For example, if you have to prove that $\aleph_1\leq2^{\aleph_0}$, then you need to first understand what all those symbols mean. $\aleph_1$ is the cardinal of the least uncountable ordinal, $\omega_1$; $2^{\aleph_0}$ is the cardinal of $\mathcal P(\Bbb N)$; $\leq$ means that there is an injection from $\omega_1$ into $\mathcal P(\Bbb N)$. So we need to show that there is such injection. If you&#8217;re unclear as to what do $\mathcal P$, &#8220;uncountable&#8221; and &#8220;injection&#8221; mean, then you have more definitions to unfold here.</p>
<p>Now we think. We create this graph of theorems and associations. What do we know about a power set? <em>We know that $|X|\lt|\mathcal P(X)|$. Therefore the cardinal $2^{\aleph_0}$ is uncountable. We know that the axiom of choice implies that every two cardinals are comparable. We know that $\aleph_1$ is the <strong>smallest</strong> uncountable cardinal, therefore it cannot be strictly larger than $2^{\aleph_0}$. Ah, so we know that $\aleph_1\leq2^{\aleph_0}$.</em></p>
<p>The above description seems to include some redundancies. Students expect questions without any redundant details. Last year when I had a question with a minor additional detail (some function didn&#8217;t need to be surjective), I got complaints from students that they didn&#8217;t have to use that information. But that&#8217;s actually a good thing. To know and understand that some details are not needed, but maybe they are there to guide you towards some nontrivial piece of information. </p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t use the definition of $\leq$, but rather some abstract theorem about it and the cardinals involved; and we didn&#8217;t really use $\mathcal P(\Bbb N)$ and $\omega_1$; not to mention that we sort of skipped over a few trivial things. But was mentioning them really redundant information?</p>
<p>However there are two fine points here: the first being that these details help give us a more complete picture of the problem. Even if you don&#8217;t use all these details; and the second point is that the theorems that we did cite, did rely on that information implicitly. So it is always good to refresh your memory with these things. Of course, when you&#8217;re well trained in a particular topic, you have a rather comprehensive bedrock which is why your brain already made those connections and it was trivial to prove that $\aleph_1\leq2^{\aleph_0}$.</p>
<p>Now you might wonder, we could have written so many more details. We could have appealed to a dozen other definitions and theorems. Why these ones? Well. That requires practice. You will probably write <em>all</em> the theorems and definitions at first. And with time, and solutions, your brain will train itself to find those quicker connections where you don&#8217;t have to go all the way down to the turtles. Instead you only had to write the immediate definitions and one or two theorems.</p>
<p>And when you&#8217;ve got to that point, you know that you&#8217;re ready for the next level of exercises.</p>
<p>In any case, this is why I always tell my students in introductory courses that the first thing to do when you read an exercise is to read it and understand it. And when we do a homework question from the week before on the board, I usually copy it on the blackboard and ask my students what is the first thing to do here. Many times someone will shout &#8220;You do this mathematical manipulation&#8221; to which I always say &#8220;No. We first read and understand the problem!&#8221; and then we review the question, the relevant definitions, and then we usually move to the earlier suggestion. I strongly suggest every TA, or a professor that solves problems on the board with students, to do. It keeps students involved and the break from &#8220;dive into the proof&#8221; is always refreshing to students, even if they won&#8217;t admit it.</p>
<p>Finally, since we brought up Feynman and education. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFPe-DwULM" target="_blank">Here is a marvelous video</a> of him explaining why he does not want to explain magnets and magnetic force. It&#8217;s taken from &#8220;Fun to Imagine&#8221; (see <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/feynman/" target="_blank">this page</a>), and if you have the time, you should watch the entire thing or at least his explanation on fire which culminates in the poetic imagery that when you burn a piece of wood, the light and heat from the fire is the light that came from the sun, and was the energy that broke apart the carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen which are reuniting in the flames. Awesome.</p>]]></summary>

<p><em>Abstract</em>: In this talk we aim to classify automorphisms of ultrahomogeneous structures up to conjugacy. (Ultrahomogeneous structures are highly self-symmetric and can be viewed as a kind of generic limit of their finite pieces.) In past talks I gave several examples of homogeneous structures and settled the classification problem for their automorphisms. After reviewing the classical combinatorial framework, we will generalize the methods that worked for specific examples to broader classes of ultrahomogeneous structures.</p>]]></summary>

  <p>Do not worry about your difficulties with MathML; I can assure you that mine are still greater.</p>

  <p>â <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#1940s">not Albert Einstein</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have written about why <a href="/0175/">I care about MathML</a> and why I care about <a href="/0176/">Native MathML</a>. Time to talk about some of the problems I see.</p>

<p>This piece reflects my personal opinion and is not indicative of the position of any project I might work on. It is meant as a conversation starter.</p>

<p>I care very much about MathML and in particular the mission of the W3C Math Working Group <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/Documents/Charter2006.html">to facilitate and promote the use of the Web for mathematical and scientific communication</a>. Yet, while MathML has succeeded everywhere else, it struggles on the web. That worries me.</p>

<h2 id="the-rise-and-fall-of-mathml">The rise and fall of MathML</h2>

<p>MathML did not start out as an XML language but as the <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> tag in HTML3. It was the browser vendors (Microsoft, Netscape) who rejected it; as a result, <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> went into XML âexileâ (where it was immensely successful) and returned to HTML in HTML5.</p>

<p>Still, all OWP technologies stand and fall with the support and adoption from browser vendors. It does not matter how good (or bad) a web standard is or how well it works elsewhere. Browser vendor adoption is the only relevant measure.</p>

<h2 id="no-news-is-not-good-news">No news is not good news</h2>

<p>Itâs been two years since I started to write <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/mathml-forges-on.html">âMathML forges onâ</a>.</p>

<p>Back then, native browser support seemed to be on the tipping point. Dave Barton had done amazing work on improving Alex Milowskiâs WebKit code, the deactivation in Chrome seemed to be a hiccup due to one single bug (that already had a fix). It seemed, with a little luck, Gecko/Firefox and WebKit/Safari would have made it to the 80/20 point within a year, hopefully in turn get the Blink/Chrome team to re-enable MathML; then weâd watch as Trident/IE (now Edge) would hurry to integrate the math support from LineServices.</p>

<p>Two years later, Gecko has moved sideways, WebKit has barely moved, Trident/Edge remains a mystery, and Blink is âthe villainâ (for dropping the WebKit MathML code). MathML is still the only viable markup language for mathematics (recently reaffirmed by its ISO standardization), and yet, native browser support seems just as far away as ever.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<h2 id="who-implements-native-mathml-support">Who implements native MathML support?</h2>

<p>Geckoâs and WebKitâs (still quite partial) support has been almost exclusively implemented by volunteer contributors (and mostly unpaid volunteers at that).</p>

<p>Effectively, no browser vendor has ever worked on MathML support in their browser. (Yes, thatâs a bit unfair to Mozilla devs who are great â sorry. There are also good people at Apple, Google, Microsoft; still, the companies all fail to invest in MathML browser support.)</p>

<p>The volunteers, on the other hand, come and go. Nobody is able to find significant funding and development is, once again, effectively dead.</p>

<p>At this point, I donât see how we can ever get sufficient native MathML support in browsers; the volunteer method does not work and the vendors remain uninterested.</p>

<h2 id="where-could-we-go-instead">Where could we go instead?</h2>

<p>The fact that browser vendors do not implement MathML says virtually nothing about MathML. Studying past discussions, itâs clear that there isnât a lot of knowledge about the spec or the requirements of mathematical layout. (Again, this is a little unfair to some Mozilla devs.)</p>

<p>So I see no reason to give up on MathML, let alone math and science notation on the web. Because one thing has not changed: itâs still the best markup for math â and education, industry, and research need a good markup that works on the web.</p>

<p>While I donât think native browser implementations is a realistic goal at this point, I think MathML can still be a trail blazer, especially for scientific notation. It is, after all, a long standing W3C standard and we know it works very well in a browser context (even if you need polyfills).</p>

<p>I think there are two problems we can focus on that are just as useful to move scientific markup (and the web in general) forward:</p>

<ol>
  <li>how to do mathematical layout using the web standards that are widely implemented (and how to improve both)</li>
  <li>how to expose the underlying markup to all tools that understand it</li>
</ol>

<p>As opposed to native browser support for MathML, both of these are extremely feasible.</p>

<p>For the first, it recently became clear to that modern browsers (IE9+) are actually good enough for layout; that is, you can write converters from MathML to HTML or SVG markup so that the result is stable, i.e., provides the same layout on all browsers (comparable to TeX quality but naturally integrated into the page context). To be clear, this is not (just) about client-side rendering like MathJax (in fact, MathJax does not provide this yet).</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that the necessary markup itself is messy, making it hard to generate (just look at the spans-spans-spans that MathJax currently generates).</p>

<p>But is this unusual? I think this situation is not unlike how grids using Bootstrap or Foundation are overly complicated compared to grids using css-grid layout. Or how doing flexbox-like layout is horribly complicated without flexbox.</p>

<p>I think we should focus on widely implemented standards and work on improving them so that the markup you need for good math layout becomes cleaner and thus easier to generate (both in terms of structure/semantics and performance).</p>

<p>For the second point, looking at the developments of the semantic web, itâs obviously not being realized in terms of mandated HTML tags or CSS properties. It is being realized via ARIA roles, RDFa, microdata etc. Iâm not saying these approaches work for the semantic structure of MathML (let alone STEM in general) but something along those lines seems achievable.</p>

<p>Frankly, Iâm a bit tired of waiting for <del>Godot</del> native browser support for MathML. MathML is frozen because weâre all waiting for browsers to catch up. It is simply not happening. Letâs look for ways to move forward.</p>

    <p>MathJax has managed to attract a significant network of donors. Why donât they either encourage their âinvestorsâ to also invest in native math rendering, or why donât they use the proceeds to fund native development directly? This shouldnât be beyond their bylaws.</p>

    <p>Interesting blog post!  Iâve two comments to make.</p>

    <p>Easy one first: I feel like you are unnecessarily harsh on the quality of Geckoâs MathML support.  While I understand your pride in MathJax, Iâd still put Gecko at 90/10 or better rather than 80/20 or below.  It certainly can use improvement and is more variable, depending on system fonts, etc, and Iâd definitely appreciate more official support from Mozilla. But it gets all the essentials and with the right fonts looks virtually as good as MathJax â and itâs blindingly fast in comparison.</p>

    <p>This is more than a fanboy stance: I think thereâs a psychological factor to this as well, when the message seems to be that no matter what is done, itâs never good enough.</p>

    <p>The second issue is a bit more subtle. On the one hand, you  advocate strongly for MathML; on the other, you propose to focus on âwidely implemented standardsâ for doing mathematical layout. There seems a big ambiguity there: Are you suggesting that authors should create &amp; serve MathML in their web pages and that the way forward is in improving and using the better supported standards as a way of rendering the MathML?  Or are you suggesting using whatever technology is available to render something that looks like math, whether or not the representation is MathML? I suspect the former, hope for it, but whichever stance you take, Iâd prefer to see it more explicit.  The ambiguity just feeds the suspicions about MathJax in some and provides an excuse to abandon MathML in others.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the thought provoking article;<br />

        </blockquote>

        <p>This post is really not about MathJax. In many ways, the opposite. But the only ones who could claim pride in MathJax would be Davide and Robert; certainly not me.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Iâd still put Gecko at 90/10 or better rather than 80/20 or below</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Iâve often described Gecko as the baseline for MathML feature support. If you canât make your MathML work in Gecko, you probably shouldnât be using it.  </p>

        <p>But I also understand why people disagree with that. In my experience, you need to be quite knowledgeable about Geckoâs implementation (at least from the outside) to avoid running into layout quirks or missing features; watching the MediaWiki math extension feedback is a good example for this.</p>

        <p>Of course, this is nothing special, the same is true about MathJax. But the problem is that no large scale MathML adopter Iâve ever talked to is willing or able to spend the resource on optimizing their content for Firefox.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>[â¦] depending on system fonts [â¦]</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Thatâs not a minor issue though. The switch to MATH tables has brought quite a few problems in terms of layout and more importantly developer burden.</p>

        <p>While MATH tables seem to be the way to go, they can only be leveraged by native implementations (and there arenât exactly many fonts with MATH tables, nor would I expect that expensive niche to grow much soon).</p>

        <p>This adds to the burden of front end developers who would have to provide two sets of webfonts â one for Gecko and one for everyone else (i.e., polyfills). Itâs another case of a good standard being useless because itâs not widely implemented. But itâs made worse because polyfills cannot leverage it so thereâs no positive feedback loop.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>itâs blindingly fast in comparison.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Sure. Thatâs why Iâm not talking about client-side rendering here but for the generation of HTML with CSS. This includes tools like LaTeXML or pandoc or any XML workflow tool.</p>

        <p>(But fun fact: weâve seen edge cases of client-side MathJax outperforming Firefox by a clear margin. I got lucky and was able to mention it to Rob OâCallahan personally and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1139709">Gecko got improvements</a>.)</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>I donât think the problem is ânever good enoughâ. MathJax is certainly not âgood enoughâ for many people (in particular in terms of performance, but also layout, feature support etc).</p>

        <p>I think the problem is rather âno chance of getting betterâ. There is no interest from the browser companies; thatâs what would have to change.</p>

        <p>I think even a limited implementation would be interesting if developers had the promise that bugs will get fixed and implementations moved forward. This is not some kind of chicken-and-egg problem, itâs simply a failure of browser vendors (and just to repeat myself: not of individual browser developers!).</p>

        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>

        <p>Neither and both. Authors should use whatever works for them. If thatâs asciimath during authoring or even in the final page, thatâs fine; I donât lose sleep over it. (Just like nobody loses sleep over somebody converting markdown in the page.) I do think that authoring tools and converters should <em>not</em> stop at MathML but think further because waiting for MathML support to come around is not helping.</p>

        <p>I would like to see those tools move MathML forward by making it the best markup for rendering math on the OWP. But Iâm not thinking of something that âjustâ looks like math but about HTML or SVG markup that is enriched to be just as powerful as its underlying MathML. Thatâs currently not possible for lack of, e.g., aria roles. But I think wecould quickly get to a point where a fully equivalent âinterpretationâ (or âtranspilationâ to use a fashionable term) in HTML or SVG does not require client-side rendering.</p>

        <blockquote>

        <p>My piece opens with âThis piece reflects my personal opinion and is not indicative of the position of any project I might work on.â This obviously includes MathJax.</p>

        <p>MathJax is a MathML rendering engine. Iâm proposing to something based on MathML and my hope is to move MathML forward despite the lack of interest from browser vendors.</p>

        <p>But if somebody needs an excuse to âabandonâ MathML, Iâd prefer to convince them by showing them how great MathML is rather than saying âoh, just wait a few more years and browser vendors will finally get it and implement itâ. MathML deserves better!</p>

        <p>FUD? Perhaps, but the fact that Iâm paranoid, doesnât mean that Iâm not being followed. :&gt;</p>

        <p>MathML offers a representation of math in such a form as to enable: high-quality rendering; accessibility; reuse (especially content). One would have hoped for gradual adoption &amp; implementation of MathML, starting with the aspects that are both âeasiestâ and most in demand: rendering first; increasing support for accessibility; and eventually support for reuse. That seems to me a critical evolutionary path if true accessibility and reuse of mathematics will ever be achieved.</p>

        <p>Alas, math is a niche; generating good MathML and rendering it is non-trivial, content moreso. And, as you point out, browser support seems stalled, at best.</p>

        <p>While your proposed solution of improving HTML+CSS, RDF and aria seems practical and innocent, without a strong and simultaneous call for continued improvement of native MathML support in browsers and its generation by authors as well as the actual serving of MathML, thereâs the danger of undermining that evolutionary path of MathML support. I donât believe thatâs your intention, but the implication that authors need only serve HTML+CSS for rendering, imagining theyâll someday add aria annotation, eliminates the most pressing reasons for wanting MathML in the first place. Reuse of mathematics, or even truly useful accessibility remain mere pipe-dreams.</p>

        <p>â¦</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>Thanks; Thatâs what I was hoping to hear. I just want to make sure that message doesnât get lost in the shuffle. If we give the impression that rendering and a modicum of accessibility is âgood enoughâ, we may as well just leverage the browserâs improvements in image rescaling, attach little tape-recordings to the images, and call it done.</p>

          <p>While your proposed solution of improving HTML+CSS, RDF and aria seems practical and innocent, without a strong and simultaneous call for continued improvement of native MathML support in browsers and its generation by authors as well as the actual serving of MathML, thereâs the danger of undermining that evolutionary path of MathML support.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I disagree. As I wrote, I donât see any practical interest from vendors towards implementing MathML. So calling for improvements is pointless â they are not doing anything.</p>

        <p>Iâd be thrilled to be wrong and see browser vendors dedicate the necessary resources to MathML development (and maybe join the MathWG to help move the spec forward).</p>

        <p>But if Iâm not wrong, then âWaiting for Improvementsâ will be worthy of Beckett.</p>

        <p>As much as I care about MathML, I care even more about mathematics on the web. Since native MathML support is not happening, I think MathML needs to evolve into something that can be native. My suggestion voiced here is that it should evolve towards HTML and CSS.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>but the implication that authors need only serve HTML+CSS for rendering, imagining theyâll someday add aria annotation, eliminates the most pressing reasons for wanting MathML in the first place.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I think âeliminatesâ is misleading. First, I disagree because you cannot âeliminateâ whatâs not there. MathML is not usable on the web (without polyfills) because browser vendors are not supporting it.</p>

        <p>Secondly, I disagree because I believe that only MathML will allow us to move towards âHTML as powerful as MathMLâ.</p>

        <p>Thatâs the whole point of this piece, really: imho browser support will not happen, so letâs think about ways how the spec (and maybe even the MathWG) can evolve to fulfill its mission.  </p>

        <p>And I obviously and strongly believe that MathML is the best basis for doing so.</p>

        <p>But unless somebody can get browser vendors to dedicate the necessary resources, then I find it unhelpful to sit around and pretend like MathML is working out on the web. Instead, we should think hard about how it can be made to help math and science on the web (without native MathML implementations).</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Reuse of mathematics, or even truly useful accessibility remain mere pipe-dreams.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Again, I disagree. On the one hand, it is really pretty easy to achieve exposure of the underlying MathML â just look at what ChromeVox did already years ago with MathJax, leveraging the internal MathML to enable fully accessible exploration of the visual output.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, I think âreuse of mathematicsâ is too broad. I think quite a few use cases that people hope for are unrealistic (e.g., copy&amp;paste has so many challenges on the web, with or without MathML). And the realistic ones (e.g., accessibility, search) can be achieved in HTMLified-MathML (pretty easily, I think).</p>

        <p>As much as I care about MathML, I care even more about mathematics on the web. Since native MathML support is not happening, I think MathML needs to evolve into something that can be native. My suggestion voiced here is that it should evolve towards HTML and CSS.</p>

        <p>No. But probably for very different reasons than you might think.</p>

        <p>But Iâm not very interested in discussing technical details here. This is a conversation starter, not a technical document. If MathWG wants to consider this direction, then I think we need to bring together practitioners first. And thatâs practitioners who deal with rendering MathML in a web context; thatâs not exactly a strong suit of the WG today.</p>

        <p>I also need to slightly correct (or extend) my previous comment to include what I mentioned in the post: I might prefer HTML but I also think SVG should be an equal target. For example, your LaTeXML can already generate SVGs for MathML; why make it less useful than it could be if you already have good underlying data in the form of MathML?</p>

        <updated>2015-08-07T00:44:55Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am not a Platonist.</p>
<p>In general, while I do find it entertaining to think about god, afterlife, or a concrete mathematical universe, I find more comfort in the uncertainty of existence than I do in the likelihood that my belief is wrong, or in the terrifying conviction that comes along with believing in something (and everyone else is wrong).</p>
<p>So in particular, I don&#8217;t believe there is a concrete mathematical universe where $\ZF$ or $\ZFC$ governs things. So I don&#8217;t believe that mathematical questions which involve anything larger than we can comprehend <em>should</em> have a definitive and concrete answer (e.g. what is the value of Graham&#8217;s number? What is the largest number that we can compute, experimentally? And other ill-defined questions which often have an answer depending on your coordinates within time and space).</p>
<p>The best example of such problem is the Continuum Hypothesis. Cantor hypothesized that $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1$ in 1878, 1882 and 1895 (see <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/a/135916/7206">this historical overview for details</a>). It took some time, but after formalizing the notion of sets, logic, and so on, it was finally shown that under a relatively broad notion of &#8220;set&#8221; it is impossible to prove or disprove the continuum hypothesis. In fact, in the absence of the axiom of choice, Cantor&#8217;s different formulations over the years are not even equivalent (see <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/a/404813/622">this overview</a>).</p>
<p>After being shown independent, there had been more than a handful of people who called out that a question without a yes or no answer is a wrong question. And I disagree. Vehemently. &#8220;What is for dinner&#8221; before anything is cooking a definite problem? Is &#8220;Who let the dogs out&#8221; a definite problem? Is &#8220;Given $f\colon\Bbb{R\to R}$, is $f$ continuously differentiable&#8221; a definite problem?</p>
<p>All these questions need <em>more</em> information to be properly answered. They all depend on much much more than just the information given in the question. If the Continuum Hypothesis <em>has</em> to have an answer, then it is just a witness that $\ZFC$ is not sufficiently strong to describe the &#8220;true&#8221; universe of mathematics and sets, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>But why should everything have a definite answer? GÃ¶del&#8217;s incompleteness theorem tells us that if we want to keep working in a setting that (1) has an algorithmic proof verification method; (2) can describe sufficient amount of arithmetic; (3) is not inconsistent, then it is necessarily the case that our setting is incomplete. Why is that such a bad thing? It just goes to show that (1) proving things is important; and (2) much like the physical reality, we cannot know everything, and we will not know everything.</p>
<p>Humans are generally scared of not knowing. And it makes sense that you want to know. But why should we expect to be able to know? Amongst the sonic and light spectra, we are mostly blind and mostly deaf. Why should we be surprised that in the mathematical spectrum we will also be lacking? We shouldn&#8217;t be. If anything, that is consistent with our reality. And if someone wants to argue in favor of realism, then &#8220;not knowing&#8221; is far more realistic than &#8220;knowing&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what about the continuum hypothesis? Well. I don&#8217;t know. As I said, I am not a Platonist. I do not feel the need to believe in a yes/no answer to every &#8220;Is it &#8230;&#8221; question I ask. But I do think that the continuum hypothesis is a very concrete, very definite problem. Its solution being independent of $\ZFC$ shows one of two things: (1) As far as Platonist viewpoint go, $\ZFC$ is insufficient to describe the true nature of mathematics; and (2) maybe Platonism isn&#8217;t the way the go.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com/2015/05/19/voevodsky-trending-2/comment-page-1/#comment-295">a comment on Michael Harris&#8217;</a> blog some time ago. I was confused as to why someone who is a Platonist is not working in a &#8220;maximally consistent theory&#8221;. If you believe that something is true, it makes no sense to work in a theory where it is not true. Especially if you argue in its favor, and even more if you know that you cannot prove it otherwise. Sure, this runs into problems since you will probably grow into the realm of a theory which is not recursively enumerable, so proofs cannot be checked with an algorithm anymore. But if you believe this is all true, then why does it matter? </p>
<p>And while I do understand that Platonist or not, you want to work with axioms that other people accept as well, which gives us an &#8220;incomplete intersection of assumptions&#8221; (since the union is almost always inconsistent). But this is more the reason to either work towards adding more axioms to the accepted foundations of mathematics, or prove more theorems of the form &#8220;If such and such holds, then so on and so forth&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a reason to claim that a question which cannot be answered naively is not a good question. </p>]]></summary>

<p><em>Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma</em>, proved by Ehrenfeucht in 1973 [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_11">1</a>], is a very powerful tool in the model theory of models of Peano Arithmetic (${\rm PA}$). </p>
<p><strong>Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma</strong>: If $a\neq b$ are elements of a model $M\models{\rm PA}$, and $b$ is definable from $a$ in $M$, then $a$ and $b$ must have different types. </p>
<p>Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma can be used to show, for example, that if a model $M\models{\rm PA}$ is the Skolem closure of a single element $a$, $M={\rm Scl(\{a\})}$, then it has no non-trivial automorphisms. Since every element of $M$ is definable from $a$, $a$ is the unique element of its type and therefore any automorphism must map $a$ to $a$, thereby fixing everything. It is not difficult to see why Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma holds for models of ${\rm PA}$. Suppose $b$ is definable from $a$ in $M\models {\rm PA}$. By tweaking the definition slightly, we can assume that there is a definable function $f(x)$ such that $f(a)=b$. First, suppose that $a&#60;b$. Consider the definable (undirected) graph $G$ consisting of all pairs $\{x,y\}$ such that $f(x)=y$ and $x&#60;y$. The pair $\{a,b\}\in G$. Because ${\rm PA}$ proves that $&#60;$ is a well-order, $G$ is loop-free. Let $c$ be the $&#60;$-least element connected to $a$. Then $c$ is also the $&#60;$-least element connected to $b$. But the shortest distance from $a$ to $c$ differs by $1$ from the shortest distance from $b$ to $c$, and so one is even if and only if the other is odd. The case $b&#60;a$ uses the same idea.</p>
<p>Historically, there has been a very fruitful exchange of concepts, methods, and techniques between model theory of models of arithmetic and model theory of models of set theory. So it was natural to ask about Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma for models of set theory. An identical argument to the one given above shows that if $V\models{\rm ZF}$ has a definable global well-ordering ($V={\rm HOD}$), then Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma holds. More generally, it shows that in any $V\models{\rm ZF}$, Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma holds for ordinal definable sets. In [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_12">2</a>], we showed that in general Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma can fail for a model of set theory. Indeed it fails in a very strong way in any Cohen forcing extension. </p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Every Cohen forcing extension $V[c]$ has $a\neq b$ that are inter-definable and have the same type, even with parameters from $V$.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the Cohen poset is isomorphic to the $\omega$-fold finite-support product of Cohen forcing. Let $G$ be $V$-generic for the $\omega$-fold finite-support product of Cohen forcing and let $\langle c_i\mid i&#60;\omega\rangle\in V[G]$ be the Cohen reals on the coordinates of $G$. In $V[G]$, let $C=\{c_i\mid i&#60;\omega\}$, let $E=\{c_{2i}\mid i&#60;\omega\}$ be Cohen reals on even coordinates, and let $O=\{c_{2i+1}\mid i&#60;\omega\}$ be Cohen reals on odd coordinates. The pairs $\langle C,E\rangle$ and $\langle C,O\rangle$ are obviously inter-definable in $V[G]$, and an automorphism argument shows that they have the same type (even with parameters from $V$) in $V[G]$. From what is known so far, it is possible that Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma holds precisely when $V={\rm HOD}$. This question is completely open.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Does Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma imply $V={\rm HOD}$ in models of ${\rm ZF(C)}$?</p>
<p>By considering parametric versions of Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma, we arrived at a collection of principles, which we call <em>Ehrenfeucht principles</em>, a scheme that captures several interesting properties of models of set theory. We say that the Ehrenfeucht principle ${\rm EL}(A,P,Q)$ holds for a model $V\models{\rm ZF}$ and $A,P,Q\subseteq V$ if for every $a\in A$, if $b\neq a$ is definable from $a$ using parameters in $P$, then $a$ and $b$ have different types with parameters in $Q$. In short, $P$-definability implies $Q$-discernibility. In this new scheme, the original Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma is ${\rm EL}(V,\emptyset,\emptyset)$ and we know that ${\rm EL}({\rm OD},\emptyset,\emptyset)$ holds in every $V\models{\rm ZF}$. We also know that ${\rm EL}(V[c],\emptyset,V)$ fails in any Cohen extension $V[c]$. Let&#8217;s consider some other notable Ehrenfeucht principles. The principle ${\rm EL}(V,{\rm ORD},{\rm ORD})$ states that if $a\neq b$ and $b$ is definable from $a$ with ordinal parameters, then $a$ and $b$ have differen types with ordinal parameters. We can think of ${\rm EL}(V,{\rm ORD},{\rm ORD})$ as a first-order expressible version of Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma. The principle ${\rm EL}(V,V,\emptyset)$ states that any $a\neq b$ have different types, e.g. there are no indiscernibles. Ali Enayat calls such models <em>Leibnizian</em> in honor of Leibniz who posited in his <em>Identity of Indiscernibles</em> principle that any two objects must differ on some property. The property of being Leibnizian is not first-order (Ehrenfeucht and Mostowski showed that every first-order theory $T$ with an infinite model, has a model with indiscernibles), but it is closely related to a first-order property that Enayat has called the <em>Leibniz-Mycielski axiom</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Leibniz-Mycielski axiom</strong>: (${\rm LM}$) Any two $a\neq b$ have different types in some $V_\alpha$. </p>
<p>Mycielski showed in [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_13">3</a>] that a theory $T$ extending ${\rm ZF}$ has a Leibnizian model if and only if it proves ${\rm LM}$. It is not difficult to see that ${\rm LM}$ is itself equivalent to the principle ${\rm EL}(V,V,{\rm ORD})$ which states that any $a\neq b$ have different types with ordinal parameters. Thus, a theory $T$ has a model in which distinct elements have different types if and only if in every model of $T$ distinct elements have different types with ordinal parameters. </p>
<p>The Leibniz-Mycielski axiom is equivalent over ${\rm ZF}$ to the existence of a definable injection from $V$ into subsets of ordinals [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_14">4</a>]. In particular, it implies that there is a definable global linear-ordering of $V$, and so we can think of it as a weak global choice principle. Easton first showed in his dissertation that there are models of ${\rm ZFC}$ without a definable global linear-ordering (see <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/110799/does-zfc-prove-the-universe-is-linearly-orderable" target="_blank">this</a> MO post for Hamkins&#8217; argument). It is not known whether ${\rm LM}$ implies the existence of a definable global well-ordering of $V$ over ${\rm ZFC}$ and this is a major open question. </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Does ${\rm LM}$ imply over ${\rm ZFC}$ that $V$ has a definable global well-ordering?</p>
<p>A very related open question is whether there is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ with a definable global linear-ordering, but not a definable global well-ordering (see <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/111370/can-there-be-a-global-linear-ordering-of-the-universe-without-a-global-well-orde" target="_blank">this</a> MO post). </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a model $V\models{\rm ZFC}$ with a definable global linear-ordering, but no definable global well-ordering?</p>
<p>Solovay showed that over ${\rm ZF}$, ${\rm LM}$ doesn&#8217;t even imply countable choice [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_14">4</a>]. The argument proceeds by forcing to add $\omega$-many <em>Jensen reals</em> (with finite-support) over $L$ and then showing that $L(S)$, where $S$ is the collection of the $\omega$-many Jensen reals from the generic filter, is a model of ${\rm LM}$, but not of countable choice. This uses a key property of Jensen reals that $S$ is definable. Jensen&#8217;s forcing adds a unique generic real over $L$ and a (modern) way to see that $S$ is definable is to use a recent theorem of Kanovei showing that the Jensen reals added by an $\omega$-fold finite-support product over $L$ are precisely the reals on the coordinates of the generic filter [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_15">5</a>]. </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally completed the blog migration I started a few months ago. Moving away from WordPress forced me to re-think a few parts and re-work a lot of content by hand. This was tedious but forced a worthwhile bit of introspection.</p>

<h2 id="permalinks">Permalinks</h2>

<p>Oh, permalinks. The name is so clean and yet so misleading. WordPress is so forgiving to both admins, authors and visitors. But leaving that paradise is fun, too. At one point I had renamed all posts in a way which led to a site with zero posts; hilarious.</p>

<p>Iâve switched to the simplest permalink structure â enumeration. But then the question was: how many digits (I like my numbers to be the same string length)? I ended up with four digits. This is No.181 after 5 years of writing on the web, so it seems rather unlikely Iâll reach 9999 in my life time. And if I do, Iâd be happy to revisit this (@future self: sorry! itâll be a pain!).</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments.</h2>

<p>Iâve been discussing the changes with Sam over the past few months. The biggest point of disagreement has been comments. Jekyll canât provide comments (obviously) and I am not interested in going back to Disqus (for various reasons). I also had the impression that comments were not doing it for me anymore. The ratio spam / useful comment was about 1000 to 1. Sure, Akismet took care of this and Disqus could, too. In addition, Iâd get comments from other places (twitter, g+ or plain email) and since <del>Iâm not a cool indieweb dev</del> itâs never that many, I manually added them to posts.</p>

<p>In other words, I started to feel like comments are just not that useful anymore (caveat lector: see below) and that having a special technology for it seems overkill.</p>

<p>So for now, Iâm going with comments-by-email, with a simple link at the end of each post, prepped with a subject line for you. Comments will then be added by myself. Iâm hoping anybody willing to comment is willing to send me an email (anonymous or not). Maybe Iâm wrong. Iâll also pull in comments from other places (e.g., twitter). Thereâs currently a hypothes.is opt-in as well. Not sure if Iâll keep it though. Feedback would be nice.</p>

<p>As always, <a href="http://xkcd.com/1357/">xkcd.com/1357</a> applies. If you really feel the need to comment, please do it on your own site.</p>

<h2 id="reviewing-my-content">Reviewing my content</h2>

<p>Having to do a lot of manual editing of my own work was a healthy experience. Yes, it drained time and varied from cringeworthy to depressing. But it also showed me that, once in a while, I still like my old writing. It also showed me some horrible crap, including one troll post which Iâm keeping to remind me never to troll again. I hope itâs the only one ð.</p>

<p>I was surprised about the number of comments. One reason to go with email comments was the general lack of comments. Why keep extra technology on the site when I only get spam comments? But I admit I was surprised by the many (real) comments I have from my postdoc days and especially from other Boolesâ Ringers and mathblogging folks. You people are the best!</p>

<p>Oh, and it took me a while to realize that I had actually been on Jekyll before moving to WordPress. Guess that means Iâm going back to WordPress in a few years. (@future self: again, very sorry! Letâs wait until we hit 9999 posts, ok?) One thing I regret losing is the post-specific history from WordPress; couldnât get that to survive this migration (but will back the database up for myself). Hopefully git will improve this (with some auto-committing).</p>

<h2 id="broken-links">Broken links</h2>

<p>With Jekyll I switched on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/pkra/peterkrautzberger.org">some basic CI</a> (thanks, Travis CI!), including html-proofer. With ~1000 links right now, itâs no surprise that some of them are dead. Fixing the internal ones along the way of my review was easy enough. And for the rest (but not that many), I used the <a href="https://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>; a handful are actually lost forever.</p>

<p>What was surprising to me was which links needed the Wayback Machine. Itâs not surprising that some random app on appspot goes down. But something on Harvard.edu or publishers.org? Thatâs somewhat funny (and painful). Small niche blogs? They were solid. You are all awesome!</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâs next</h2>

<p>Being on such a long hiatus (also caused by having other writing projects that bled me out), I want to get back into writing here. Since this site is now a git repo, you can file bugs on the <a href="https://github.com/pkra/peterkrautzberger.org">GitHub copy</a> but also fin ideas for posts I put down as issues.</p>

<p>I was thinking about some technical posts on math on the web. And thereâs one post thatâs been in the works for months; I should finish that one. Or give it a few more months maybe; you know how these things go.</p>]]></summary>

<p>I always preferred to be the master of my domain. The king of my castle. But literally, not the Seinfeld euphemisms sense. In any case.

<p>You can find the first blurb <a href="http://boolesrings.org/asafk/blurbs/#1">here</a>. And it is, in fact, set theoretic in nature.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: In 2000, Schindler introduced remarkable cardinals and showed that the existence of a remarkable cardinal is equiconsistent with the assertion that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ is absolute for proper forcing. Remarkable cardinals can be thought of either as a  miniature version of strong cardinals or as having aspects of generic supercompactness, but they are relatively low in the large cardinal hierarchy. They are downward absolute to $L$ and lie (consistency-wise) between the 1-iterable and 2-iterable cardinals of the $\alpha$-iterable cardinals hierarchy (below Ramsey cardinals). I will discuss the indestructibility properties of remarkable cardinals, which are similar to those of strong cardinals. I will show that a remarkable cardinal $\kappa$ can be made simultaneously indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\leq\kappa$-distributive forcing and by all forcing of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)*\mathbb R$, where $\mathbb R$ is forced to be $\lt\kappa$-closed and $\leq\kappa$-distributive. For this argument, I will introduce the notion of a remarkable Laver function and show that every remarkable cardinal has one. Although, the existence of Laver-like functions can be forced for most large cardinals, few, such as strong, supercompact, and extendible cardinals, have them outright. The established indestructibility can be used to show, for instance, that any consistent continuum pattern on the regular cardinals can be realized above a remarkable cardinal and that a remarkable cardinal need not be even weakly compact in ${\rm HOD}$. This is joint work with Yong Cheng.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> We study the relationship between a $\kappa$-Souslin tree $T$ and its reduced powers $T^\theta/\mathcal U$.<br />
Previous works addressed this problem from the viewpoint of a single power $\theta$, whereas here, tools are developed for controlling different powers simultaneously.<br />
As a sample corollary, we obtain the consistency of an $\aleph_6$-Souslin tree and a sequence of uniform ultrafilters $\langle \mathcal U_n\mid n&lt;6\rangle$ such that $ T^{\aleph_n}/\mathcal U_n$ is $\aleph_6$-Aronszajn iff $n&lt;6$ is not a prime number.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are the rules of research. Feel free to add your own.</p>
<ol>
<li>If it seems obvious, it&#8217;s probably false as stated.</li>
<li>If it seems obvious and true, it&#8217;s probably false without additional hypotheses.</li>
<li>If you think that you wrote a proof, you probably missed something obvious. See (1) and/or (2).</li>
<li>You missed something obvious, see (1).</li>
<li>When you go to see your advisor, suddenly all your thoughts align, and you find the solution.</li>
<li>Two hours after finally talking with your advisor, you realize that your solution is obvious, therefore (1) or (2) apply.</li>
<li>If you use forcing to prove the argument, then you probably missed some object being encoded generically.</li>
<li>If you use forcing, and you didn&#8217;t miss some crucial object, then you missed some other crucial object not being coded by the generic.</li>
<li>When the truth is found to be lies, and all the joy within you dies&#8230;</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not false if you can force it.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not true if you used the axiom of choice more than three times in the proof.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not cheating if you asked a visitor to the university whose visit did not span longer than two weeks from the moment you asked them.</li>
<li>If your question was about inner models, you may extend the above timespan to a month. Equally, if the question is about the axiom of choice, it should be shortened to a week.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not considered unethical to make sacrifice in order to appease Mayan and Aztec gods. Just in case we got it wrong, and they&#8217;re in charge of the mathematical universe.</li>
<li>If it still seems obvious, you&#8217;re probably right. It&#8217;s still false, though.</li>
<li>If you need six technical lemmas, whose proof is reduced to a single line (or just one lemma with an actual proof), then it&#8217;s probably obvious. Unfortunately, see (1) and (2).</li>
<li>If by some chance something is obvious, but you wrote out the proof, and it checks out, then it wasn&#8217;t obvious at all.</li>
<li>Remember what the dormouse said: feed your head.</li>
<li>If you haven&#8217;t watched Futurama in a while, then you&#8217;re doing something wrong.</li>
<li>Whatever happens, it&#8217;s the other guy&#8217;s fault. Also, see (1).</li>
<li>I just work here, you know? I don&#8217;t.</li>
<li>Rolling a D20 die to determine the truth value of a statement is the original algorithm behind proof verification software.</li>
<li>When you hit the wall, and you&#8217;re about to give up and decide that whatever you&#8217;re trying to prove is false, see (4).</li>
<li>The only proofs that write themselves are obvious proofs. If your proof is obvious, see (2) and (3).</li>
<li>To be honest, it needs more cowbell.</li>
<li>Seriously, you&#8217;re gonna want that cowbell in your proof.</li>
<li>See (1), (2) and (4).</li>

<p><em>Abstract</em>: Vaught&#8217;s conjecture has numerous model-theoretic and topological variations. One key connection between the model-theoretic and topological sides is provided by LÃ³pez-Escobar&#8217;s theorem, which states that any Borel class of countable structures can be axiomatized using a sentence of infinitary logic (with countable conjunctions and disjunctions). We present a variant of LÃ³pez-Escobarâs theorem for metric structures, which implies that any Borel class of separable metric structures can be axiomatized using a sentence of an appropriate infinitary continuous logic. As a consequence we obtain a new implication between the topological Vaught conjecture and a model-theoretic version for metric structures. This is joint work with Martino Lupini.</p>]]></summary>

A domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called hollow if it has a bounded complementary component. We show that for each $d \geq 2$ there exists a quasiregular map of transcendental type $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$ with a quasi-Fatou component which is hollow.</p>
<p>Suppose that $U$ is a hollow quasi-Fatou component of a quasiregular map of transcendental type. We show that if $U$ is bounded, then $U$ has many properties in common with a multiply connected Fatou component of a transcendental entire function. On the other hand, we show that if $U$ is not bounded, then it is completely invariant and has no unbounded boundary components. We show that this situation occurs if $J(f)$ has an isolated point, or if $J(f)$ is not equal to the boundary of the fast escaping set. Finally, we deduce that if $J(f)$ has a bounded component, then all components of $J(f)$ are bounded.</p>]]></summary>

<p>This summer invest in your math education.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students often ask me for advice for how to improve themselves as mathematicians. There are many answers to this question: you can focus on learning new mathematics, you can work on your programming skills, you can improve your career prospects by working on professional development, &#8230;</p>
<p>This post is the result of many conversations and coffees with undergrads; It is the advice that I would have given myself as a second-year undergrad at the University of Winnipeg. These 35 projects will also provideÂ necessary skills for completing a Ph.D. in Mathematics and will increase your employability.</p>
<p>Some of these projects will take an afternoon (&#8220;Learn how to make a bibliography in LaTeX&#8221;) and some might take a month (&#8220;Make a Predator-Prey Visualizer&#8221;). There is no time limit and no test, so take your time and make it your own.</p>

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">[B] Beginners</span></h4>
<p>Some projects are marked with a [B]. These are especially well-suited for beginners.</p>
<p><span id="more-1230"></span></p>
<h2>Math Skills</h2>
<div style="width: 415px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.shannonhartnett.com/"><img class="" src="http://www.shannonhartnett.com/images/Shannon-Milo-Cover12-03.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="615" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sometimes you need to learn specific skills.</p></div>
<p>The most common way that we think of improving as mathematicians is to &#8220;learn more math&#8221;. Sometimes it&#8217;s about learning more, and sometimes it&#8217;s about learning <em>better</em>. Here are some skills you can work on and some topics you should aim towards.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">[B] Basic Set Theory</span></h4>
<p>As soon as possible you should become familiar with the interactions of set unions and intersections with functions and inverse images. This is a prerequite to understanding analysis and topology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn all of the words in section 1 of &#8220;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4qYJArwuPtyU0lyUXRwMjYwN1k/view?usp=sharing">Things You Should Know</a>&#8221;. Know how to prove things about them and draw pictures to represent them.</li>
<li>Prove that the composition of two bijections is a bijection.</li>
<li>Prove all of the facts in section 3 of &#8220;Things You Should Know&#8221;.</li>
<li>Prove that a function from a finite set into itself is an injection if and only if it is a surjection. Show that this is not always true for infinite sets.</li>
<li>Learn the definition of a topological space. Prove that the intersection of an arbitrary family of topologies on a set X is also a topology on X.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Take an Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) Course</span></h4>
<p>IBL is a style of learning and teaching that focuses on students asking questions, making hypotheses, making mistakes and writing proofs themselves. The courses contain definitions and theorems, but no proofs (you fill them in yourself!). The courses move step by step and break down large theorems into manageable chunks.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://www.jiblm.org/downloads/jiblmjournal/V090212S/V090212S.pdf">Analysis</a>&#8221;. This is roughly equivalent to MAT 157 at the University of Toronto.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://dcernst.github.io/IBL-AbstractAlgebra/">IBL Intro to Abstract Algebra</a>&#8221;.</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://www.maa.org/publications/ebooks/number-theory-through-inquiry">Number Theory Through Inquiry</a>&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Review and Master</span></h4>
<p>Becoming stronger in mathematics is not just about looking forward and learning new things, it&#8217;s also about mastering old material, and gaining new perspectives on it. These projects focus on &#8220;looking backwards&#8221; so that you&#8217;ll have an easier time looking forwards.</p>
<p>For these projects, pick a technique or topic from a course you&#8217;ve completed recently. For example &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">Cantor&#8217;s Diagonalization Method</a>&#8221;, &#8220;<a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/SecondOrderConcepts.aspx">Linear Algebra in Differential Equations</a>&#8221;, &#8220;Picture Proofs&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers">Completeness of the Real Numbers</a>&#8221; would all be good choices. At the end of these exercises, you will be a master of the material.</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the material from your notes.</li>
<li>Explain the theorems and definitions in your own words. Write a couple of sentences explaining the relevance of each definition and theorem. If there are multiple similar theorems or definitions with slight variations, explain the differences and what makes each version special.</li>
<li>Find other notes that explain the same material.</li>
<li>Think of the likely places that readers could get confused, and point out how to resolve these issues.</li>
<li>Write your own version of the proofs of the theorems. Look for different proofs and explain the key differences in each.</li>
<li>Include connections to other branches of math and science if you can. For example, Cantor&#8217;s Diagonalization Method is the main proof technique for <a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/halt/">the Halting Problem</a>.</li>
<li>Find or invent exercises and questions that go with the ideas. Some questions should test basic understanding of definitions and theorems, some should point out common misunderstandings readers could have, some should require the reader to apply an old technique in a new way.</li>
<li>Write up these explanations in a LaTeX document. You now have a chapter of a textbook. Congratulations!</li>
<li>Move on to another topic that you want to master.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<div style="width: 336px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://theothermalebody.wordpress.com/author/simonschepers/"><img class="" src="https://theothermalebody.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/dsc063716.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="434" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is what math research looks like.</p></div>
<p>Math is a technical language and reading it is a skill that must be developed. When you first start reading papers your progress will be very slow. Don&#8217;t get discouraged! Write down lots of questions, take time to think about things, be skeptical. Just because it got printed in a journal doesn&#8217;t make it true!</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Read a Book</span></h4>
<p>Go through a math book that isn&#8217;t a textbook. Ask questions and talk to people about it.</p>

</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Read a Paper</span></h4>
<p>A lot of a mathematician&#8217;s time is spent reading papers and perusing the literature. It requires skill to read papers and generally speaking they are not written in a way that makes it easy to understand what&#8217;s going on. Read these papers and keep track of things you don&#8217;t understand and questions that come up. Try to write down a proof for anything they claim is &#8220;obvious&#8221; or &#8220;clear&#8221; or &#8220;easy&#8221;. The following papers really only assume a working knowledge of linear algebra and calculus</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://stanford.edu/~jbooher/expos/transcendence.pdf">An exposition of transcendental numbers</a> by Jeremy Booher. A more intense paper than the other three. By the end of this you will see that $e$ and $\pi$ are transcendental numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Math Projects</h2>

<p>Learning math for its own sake is fine, but sometimes its nice to have specific goals in mind. These projects will help you learn a topic while trying to accomplish a well-defined, achievable goal.</p>
<p>These are only sketches of projects; remember that you can add as much to them as you want. Personalize them! Go further!</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">[B] Characterize all Cyclic Groups</span></h4>
<p>This is a project for people who have a bit of mathematical maturity (first or second year undergrad), but have not learned about groups yet. By the end of this project you will know exactly what every cyclic group looks like. By the end of this you can stop saying &#8220;I just don&#8217;t understand group theory&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn the definition of a group. (Look at some examples if you want.)</li>
<li>Learn the definition of an abelian (i.e. commutative) group. Learn the definition of a cyclic group. Prove that every cyclic group is abelian.</li>
<li>Prove that every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.</li>
<li>Let G be a finite cyclic group, and let x be an element of G. State and prove a theorem that relates the order of x with the order of G.</li>
<li>State and prove a theorem that characterizes the cyclic groups. (It should contain a list of different groups, such that every cyclic group shows up on that list.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you like this type of math, one possible follow-up project is to characterize all abelian groups. This is a bigger task, but is often the end goal of a first course in group theory.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Make a Predator-Prey Visualizer</span></h4>
<p>Your goal is to create a simulation of a predator-prey system <a href="http://www.phschool.com/atschool/phbio/active_art/predator_prey_simulation/index.html">along the lines of this</a>. You will need a little bit of coding skill and you will need to know at least first year calculus. I will sketch out some steps you could take, but I will be vague. You should take things into your own hands and do extra research if needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the Wikipedia article on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equation">Lotka-Volterra equation</a>.</li>
<li>Here is a nice set of <a href="http://onlinemathcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lotka-Volterra-Equations.pdf">lecture notes by David Hyde [PDF]</a> that explain the relevant notions and has many good exercises.</li>
<li>You will need to learn some numerical methods for solving differential equations.

<p>Teaching is hard. Teaching is a skill. Teaching is extremely rewarding.</p>
<p>Use some of your free time in the summer to develop your teaching muscles. Good preparation outside the classroom will have a noticeable impact inside the classroom, even if it&#8217;s only a result of your higher confidence.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Redesign a Course</span></h4>
<p>Take the syllabus of a course you&#8217;ve taken in the past and reorganize the syllabus. Try these five different exercises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove every section that can be removed without compromising the main goal of the course. See how much is essential, and how much is extra.</li>
<li>Change the order of the material if possible. Can you present things in a more logical order?</li>
<li>Find an assignment you didn&#8217;t like and redesign it. Make sure that your assignment accomplishes something.</li>
<li>Redesign the course as though it was going to be taught to high school students in their last year of school. How does the course change? How do the assignments and tutorials change?</li>
<li>Design your own final exam. Make sure it covers all of the relevant material and fairly tests the students. Can it be written in 3 hours?</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Preparing Lectures and Tutorials</span></h4>
<p>Take your notes from a lecture or tutorial you&#8217;ve given in the past, and try these exercises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out the goal of the lecture and write it down. Make sure that everything in the lecture is designed to reach that goal. Remove things that aren&#8217;t helping.</li>
<li>Add <a href="http://cte-blog.uwaterloo.ca/?p=3315">signposts</a> to your written notes. These help direct your class as to where you&#8217;ve gone and where you&#8217;re going.</li>
<li>Take a guess as to the three parts of your lecture that are hardest to follow. What would your students want that would help them follow?</li>
<li>Think of and write down five questions students would have during your lecture, and write answers to those questions.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Stock Lectures</span></h4>
<p>You should have at least three lectures ready that you can give at any moment. Use this summer to develop them all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a one hour lecture for 30 general high school students.</li>
<li>Prepare a 30 minute lecture for bored parents.</li>
<li>Prepare a one hour lecture for undergrads to get them excited about math.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Professional Development</h2>
<div style="width: 326px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/Article-TomSharkey.htm"><img class="" src="http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/images/sharkey-tom-suit.jpg" alt="" width="316" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s about more than wearing a suit.</p></div>
<p>The model of a mathematician as a crazy-haired recluse working in isolation is far from how modern mathematics is practiced. Now the emphasis is placed more on connecting with other researchers, both mathematicians and those from other disciplines.</p>
<p>These projects will help make it easier to connect with others, and make it easier for them to reach out to you. Start early in your career!</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Become Familiar with the Important Math Websites</span></h4>
<p>There are many tools available for connecting with other math researchers and facilitating your own research. For each of these sites you should be able to (1) use them for their intended purpose, (2) navigate them, and (3) give a one sentence summary of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/">MathSciNet</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/">Google Scholar</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ams.org/mrlookup">MR Lookup</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/">MathStackExchange</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/">Terry Tao&#8217;s Blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Form a Web Presence</span></h4>
<p>When you go to conferences, or contact a professor, or apply for a job, people will look you up online, and you want them to find the good stuff. Make sure to keep these things active and up to date!</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your own website. Include your CV, a picture of yourself and some info about your mathematical interests. Include any relevant experience you have, some conferences that you have attended, some textbooks you have studied, some of your other online profiles (like <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>).</li>
<li>Create a LinkedIn profile.</li>
<li>Make sure your privacy settings on Facebook are high enough so that a prospective employer can&#8217;t see you doing stupid things. (In general you should also just avoid posting you doing stupid things.)</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Attend Conferences</span></h4>
<p>Networking with other mathematicians is an essential step in your career. Get out there! Start by reading <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201009/rtx100901132p.pdf">this article by Andrew Schultz</a> about the importance of networking.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cumc.math.ca/2015/home">CUMC at the University of Alberta</a> June 17-21, 2015. This is <em>the</em> undergraduate conference in mathematics. You should only not go if you have an important reason not to.</li>
<li><a href="http://ottawamc.ca/2015/index.html">Ottawa Math Conference</a> at the University of Ottawa June 19-20, 2015. Undergrads and Grad students welcome!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a graduate student, you should also look in to conferences in your specific area.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Find a Mentor</span></h4>
<p>You should have a person you trust, who is older than you, and that you can ask questions to about the path you&#8217;ve chosen. If you&#8217;re an undergrad, this can be a senior undergrad, or a grad student. If you&#8217;re a grad student, this can be a senior grad student, a post doc, or a young faculty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take your mentor out for coffee about once a month or every other month. This can vary depending on your mentor, but once a month is a good place to start.</li>
<li>Tell your mentor your concrete goals, both short term (1 month), medium term (1 year) and long term (5 years). Figure out if you&#8217;re on the path to accomplishing those goals.</li>
<li>Troubleshoot upcoming difficulties and debrief about past difficulties. Maybe you have to give a presentation at a conference, maybe you already did and it went horribly. Your mentor should have some experience to help you understand things that are giving you trouble, and how to approach them. They are there to bounce ideas off, not to tell you what to do.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other skills</h2>
<div style="width: 555px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.uncg.edu/ure/alumni_magazineT2/2011_summer/oldschool.htm"><img class="" src="http://www.uncg.edu/ure/alumni_magazineT2/2011_summer/images/545x431_oldschool-baseball-1948.jpg" alt="" width="545" height="431" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This doesn&#8217;t look like a good way to slide into a base. It looks like the fielder&#8217;s leg is in a dangerous position.</p></div>
<p>To the modern mathematician, a computer is an essential tool. We use it to compute, disseminate, connect, hypothesize, record, verify, advertise, &#8230;</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t plan on doing &#8220;math with computers&#8221;, your understanding of mathematics is enriched by knowing how computers interact with mathematics. Or, from a practical perspective, you are more employable outside of academia with coding skills.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Learn How to Code</span></h4>
<p>At some point you need to feel what it&#8217;s like to &#8220;think like a programmer&#8221;, and that will give you a richer understanding of what it means to &#8220;solve&#8221; a math problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[B]</strong> Learn Python at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. This website is fun, interactive and addictive. Python is a powerful, clear, flexible language that can be used to code many mathematical algorithms.</li>
<li>Learn R at <a href="http://tryr.codeschool.com/">Try_R</a> or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog">Coursera</a>. R is a very stats and data focused language.</li>
<li>Solve the first 25 <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems. These are all math/coding problems that involve you writing a program. After about 20 problems you will start to &#8220;think like a programmer&#8221;.</li>
<li>Subscribe to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a> and do all the challenges from a single week.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">[B] Learn LaTex</span></h4>
<p>LaTex is the language in which all mathematical writing is done. It is essential that you know how to produce LaTeX documents by the beginning of your third year of undergrad. You will need two things (1) an editor (like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <a href="http://texniccenter.sourceforge.net/">TeXnicCenter</a>, etc.) and (2) the TeX (like <a href="http://miktex.org/">MiKTeX</a>). If this is <a href="http://www.howtotex.com/howto/installing-latex-on-windows/">the first time you&#8217;ve ever done something like this</a>, it will be annoying and take you a while, but it is important.</p>
<p>These projects will give you skills you will need and use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a pdf that says &#8220;Hello World&#8221;. <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr10/cos433/Latex/latex-guide.pdf">This guide</a> will be handy.</li>
<li>Make a pdf that includes a picture. Learn how to do that <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics">here</a>.</li>
<li>Make a command that takes two arguments &#8220;x&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221; and returns the set &#8220;{x : y}&#8221;. Learn about &#8220;newcommand&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Macros">here</a>.</li>
<li>Make a TeX document that imports all of its definitions and commands from another TeX file. Learn how to use &#8220;include&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents">here</a>.</li>
<li>Label a theorem, a section and a picture, then reference them later in a document. It is best practice to use <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Labels_and_Cross-referencing">\label and \ref</a> when referring to particular objects in your TeX.</li>
<li>Make a bibliography using BibTex where the references are contained in a separate file. Learn about <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management">external bibliographies here</a>.</li>
<li>Make a presentation with two slides with <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations">Beamer</a>: one slide that says &#8220;Hello World&#8221;, one that says &#8220;Thank You&#8221;. Beamer is the standard package for presentations.</li>
<li>Write your CV in LaTex.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Learn the Basic Sorting Algorithms</span></h4>
<p>Besides stretching your mathematical muscles, if you ever have to sort assignments or tests as a TA you&#8217;ll be happy that you know some quick sorting algorithms.</p>
<ul>
<li>MIT OpenCourseWare video: &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg4bqzAqRBM">3. Insertion Sort, Merge Sort</a>&#8221;. The other videos in this series explain other types of sorting algorithms.</li>

An <a href="http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/">interactive animation</a> that helps you compare different algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hack</span></h4>
<p>Mathematics is about understanding rules as they are, not rules <em>as they should be</em>. Hacking is about exploiting the disparity between these things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/mit-guide/MITLockGuide.pdf">how to lockpick [PDF]</a> and <a href="http://www.itstactical.com/skillcom/lock-picking/how-to-open-a-padlock-with-a-coke-can/">shim a padlock</a>. See <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/">/r/Lockpicking</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline">Become Familiar a Computer Algebra System (CAS)</span></h4>
<p>Many mathematicians use computers to help with computations. In this project choose any one of the popular CAS: MatLab [<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/">Tutorial 1</a> and <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/lab/ms/matlab/matlab.html">Tutorial 2</a>], Mathematica [<a href="https://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/screencasts/handsonstart/">Tutorial</a>], Sage [<a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/index.html">Tutorial</a>] or MAPLE &#8211; [<a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/tutorials/maple1.htm">Tutorial 1</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/4jFi7CmxXAk">Tutorial 2</a>]. Generally speaking, MatLab is the one that sees the most use in industry. Some of these are very expensive, but some are free. Check with your university to see if they have some software you can use for free or for a discount.</p>
<p>Here are some sample tasks that you should be able to complete in the CAS of your choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the prime factors of 45750341.</li>
<li>Find the determinant of the matrix:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center">1Â Â  Â 2Â Â  Â 3Â Â  Â 4<br />
2Â Â  Â 3Â Â  Â 4Â Â  Â 5<br />
1Â Â  Â 1Â Â  Â 0Â Â  Â 0<br />
0Â Â  Â 1Â Â  Â 1Â Â  Â 0</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphEigenvalue.html">eigenvalues</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_graph">Petersen Graph</a>.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo method</a> to estimate $\pi$ as follows: Randomly pick points from the square $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$ and calculate what percentage of them are in the unit circle.</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When assuming the axiom of choice the product topology and box the topology are quite different when considering infinite products. For example the Tychonoff product of countably many sets of three elements is compact, metrizable an all in all a very nice space. On the other hand, the box product is not separable or second countable at all.</p>
<p>But without the axiom of choice the world is indeed a strange place. This was posted as answer <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1299027/622">on math.SE</a> earlier today.</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b> We say that $S$ is a Russell set if there exists a partition of $S$ into $P_n$ for $n\in\omega$, such that $|P_n|=2$ for all $n$, and for every infinite $I\subseteq\omega$, the product $\prod_{i\in I}P_i$ is empty.</p>
<p>Russell sets are infinite Dedekind-finite sets. They cannot be linearly ordered, and therefore witness both the failure of the axiom of countable choice (even for families of pairs, which is the least you can ask!) and the Boolean Prime Ideal theorem (which implies every set can be linearly ordered).</p>
<p>The existence of Russell sets is consistent, for example in Cohen&#8217;s second model there are Russell sets. Work in such model where a Russell set exists. Let $S$ be a Russell set, and $\{P_n\mid n\in\omega\}$ its partition into pairs witnessing this. We may assume that $S\cap\omega=\varnothing$, now define $X_n=P_n\cup\{n\}$ and $T_n=\{\varnothing,P_n,X_n\}$ is a topology on $X_n$.</p>
<p>Note that $\prod X_n$ is non-empty, but every choice function must pick co-finitely many ordinals. Therefore the space $\prod X_n$ is non-empty and so we can meaningfully define a topology on that space. Now look at the box topology defined there. If $U_n$ is a sequence of open sets, then $\prod U_n$ is non-empty if and only if $U_n\neq\varnothing$ for all $n$, and cofinitely often $U_n=X_n$.</p>
<p>This means that the box product is exactly the Tychonoff product!</p>
<p>Weird, huh?</p>]]></summary>

Hyperbolic systems have also been considered in the study of transcendental entire functions. There does not appear to be an agreed definition of the concept in this context, due to complications arising from the non-compactness of the phase space.</p>
<p>In this article, we consider a natural definition of hyperbolicity that requires expanding properties on the preimage of a punctured neighbourhood of the isolated singularity. We show that this definition is equivalent to another commonly used one: a transcendental entire functions is hyperbolic if and only if its postsingular set is a compact subset of the Fatou set. This leads us to propose that this notion should be used as the general definition of hyperbolicity in the context of entire functions, and, in particular, that speaking about hyperbolicity makes sense only within the Eremenko-Lyubich class $\mathcal{B}$ of transcendental entire functions with a bounded set of singular values.</p>
<p>We also considerably strengthen a recent characterisation of the class $\mathcal{B}$, by showing that functions outside of this class cannot be expanding with respect to a metric whose density decays at most polynomially. In particular, this implies that no transcendental entire function can be expanding with respect to the spherical metric. Finally we give a characterisation of an analogous class of functions analytic in a hyperbolic domain.</p>]]></summary>

<p>It was shown by Rippon and Stallard that the fast escaping set has no bounded components.

<p>The work in this article is concerned with two different types of families of finite sets: separating families and splitting families (they are also called &#8220;systems&#8221;). These families have applications in combinatorial search, coding theory, cryptography, and related fields. We define and study generalizations of these two notions, which we have named $n$-separating families and $n$-splitting families. For each of these new notions, we outline their basic properties and connections with the well-studied notions. We then spend the greatest effort obtaining lower and upper bounds on the minimal size of the families. For $n$-separating families we obtain bounds which are asymptotically tight within a linear factor. For n-splitting families this appears to be much harder; we provide partial results and open questions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone has been impersonating me on <a href="http://www.quora.com/about">Quora</a>. They use my real name, they link to my homepage and claim to be a set theory Ph.D. student from Jerusalem.</p>
<p><em><strong>But it&#8217;s not me.</strong></em> Even if there was another Asaf Karagila out there in the world, I think it&#8217;s pretty thin that I wouldn&#8217;t have known him since we both study at the same place and the same topic. The homepage links HERE! This one!</p>
<p>Somehow the Quora management is convinced that the identity is real (I have reported it, but the &#8220;unverified&#8221; status was removed after a few hours).</p>
<p>The account is asking a lot about Iran and Nazism related questions, and politics related nonsense topics. Anyone who has ever met me knows how much I despise these topics, and those who know me will instantly recognize this is not my work. Here are a couple of screenshots, courtesy of a friend.</p>

<p>The last question in the second one is actually shows that this cannot possibly be me. Why would anyone who was born and raised in Israel ask where to go to vacation in Israel? Why would I need Quora to find recommendation about beaches, or hotels or cities?</p>
<p>Please report that account, who goes by my name. Please report every post they make, and please help Quora understand that this is not me. Please spread the word, ask your friends who have Quora accounts to join this effort, and help me restore my identity to its original owners.</p>
<p>If you have any additional thoughts, I&#8217;d be happy to hear them.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Saturday, I participated in my first <a href="https://memming.wordpress.com/category/event/bbd-event/" target="_blank">Black Board Day</a>, an informal annual workshop dedicated to GÃ¶del and organized for the past ten years by the neuroscientist <a href="https://memming.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Memming Park</a> and his enthusiastic group of scientist friends. <span id="more-2630"></span><br />
Every year around the time of GÃ¶del&#8217;s birthday (April 28), they gather for a day of talks and discussions on topics in my research field: mathematical logic. According to workshop rules, all talks must be given, as the namesake suggests, the old fashioned way. (On a side note, we should really consider adopting this policy for the <a href="" target="_blank">set theory seminar</a> as well.) I first learned about BBDay last year, when I followed a link from a pingback on my blog and saw Memming&#8217;s post on BBDay 9 held at the University of Texas at Austen. I was super excited to find a bunch of scientists, not even all mathematicians, who like me thought that mathematical logic is very cool. So I left a comment to that effect. Meanwhile, Memming moved to Stonybrook University and BBDay moved with him to New York. This year it was held at Columbia University and I got to tell a very excited group of scientists about nonstandard models of the Peano axioms.</p>
<p><a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/05/bbday1.jpg"><img src="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/05/bbday1-300x225.jpg" alt="bbday1" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2631" /></a><br />
This was an abridged version of the <a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/2015/04/22/an-introduction-to-nonstandard-models-of-arithmetic/" target="_blank">talk</a> I recently gave at VCU (but on black board, of course). </p>
<p>It was a lively day of talks, discussions, and arguments, both mathematical and philosophical, which started out in the classroom and then moved outdoors to partake in the beautiful spring weather.</p>
<p><a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/05/bbday31.jpg"><img src="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/05/bbday31-300x225.jpg" alt="bbday3" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2634" /></a><br />
We talked about the incompleteness theorems, nonstandard models of ${\rm PA}$, Goodstein sequences, the axiom of choice, paradoxes in probability, and much much more! Just as the discussions were wrapping up, we were joined by an unlikely visitor. </p>
<p><a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/05/bbday2.jpg"><img src="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/05/bbday2-300x225.jpg" alt="bbday2" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2632" /></a><br />

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a manner more befitting to Edgar Allan Poe, Mathematics is a cruel and unforgiving mistress.</p>
<p>Mathematics will often dangle in front of you some ideas, and you will work them out, to find a mistake. Then you will go back to the beginning, find new ideas that she had in store, work those out and proceed only to find a mistake much later. Then you go back to the beginning, and you find yet another minor idea that was missing, and now when everything works you continue. But then you find another gap, and you have to go back to the beginning and hope to find yet another idea. And don&#8217;t get me started on those ideas that you find not to work during all these searches.</p>
<p>And finally, when things work out, when you&#8217;re in your eighth or ninth iteration of going back to the beginning, you&#8217;re not sure anymore if everything is falling into place because you finally nailed the right definitions, or maybe you just missed something again.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say that Mathematics enjoyed The Seventh Seal, and Antonius Block&#8217;s existentialistic journey. And most of all, I&#8217;d say it enjoyed their last sitting with the chessboard in the woods. When Antonius Block learns that the hour has come for him and his friends, and he learns that Death is not here to give us the answer, and the questions must forever torment us.</p>

<p><em>Epistemology</em> is a branch of philosophy dealing with how we know that something is true. Broadly speaking, mathematical epistemology is encompassed in the <em>axiomatic method</em>: we know that a mathematical assertion is true if it can be derived by logical inference starting from a collection of fundamental properties, called the axioms. Euclid introduced the axiomatic method in his treatise on geometry, <em>Elements</em>, around 300 BC. But a complete formal treatment of mathematics had to wait another two millennia, which is about the same time that it took for someone to finally write down the axioms of arithmetic!  In 1889, Giuseppe Peano, building on an earlier work of Dedekind, proposed an axiomatization of arithmetic. The <em>Peano axioms</em> summarize what every high school student knows about the natural numbers: addition and multiplication is commutative and associative, together they obey the distributive law, 0 is the additive identity and 1 is the multiplicative identity, the ordering is discrete and respects both addition and multiplication, and, most importantly, the principle of induction of holds. Peano&#8217;s axiomatization of arithmetic was one of many developments in the newly established field of formal mathematics. More than two millennia after Euclid&#8217;s revolutionary conceptualization, the increasingly abstract character of mathematical advances in subjects such as analysis made it imperative for mathematicians to begin developing a formal framework. The notion of function in analysis slowly morphed from a mapping given by an explicitly stated rule to an arbitrary collection of ordered pairs satisfying the property of being a function. At that point, obviously some rules needed to be imposed about which types of collections exist, leading naturally to early attempts to axiomatize set theory. </p>
<p>The axiomatic method, as conceived for most of the two millennia leading up to the critical developments in formal mathematics in the 20th century, was the view that all properties of a mathematical structure, say the natural numbers, can be proved from a correctly chosen collection of axioms. The axioms themselves were truths so self-evident that they did not require a proof. The intention was also to have the axioms determine the structure in question up to isomorphism. In this simple universe, the natural numbers would be the only structure satisfying the Peano axioms and every true arithmetical statement would be provable from them. </p>
<p>The 20th century saw a rapid succession of fundamental developments in formal mathematics. Many of them could be interpreted as demonstrating the limitations of the formal approach, but rather they revealed its hidden complexity. Cantor developed a theory of infinite collections and Zermelo codified its properties in his axiomatization of set theory. Led by Skolem, <em>first-order logic</em> was developed as a powerful and robust language of formal mathematics. The Lowenheim-Skolem theorems showed that a collection of axioms cannot determine the size of a model: every collection of axioms having an infinite model, also has models of every infinite cardinality. (A model for a collection of statements is simply a mathematical structure in which the statements hold true.) GÃ¶del (and Maltsev) proved the <em>completeness theorem</em> showing that every collection of statements from which no contradiction can be derived has a model. A powerful consequence of this, the <em>compactness theorem</em>, showed that if every finite fragment of a collection of statements has a model, then so does the entire (no matter how infinitely large) collection. Finally, GÃ¶del&#8217;s <em>first incompleteness theorem</em> showed that the Peano axioms, and in fact any reasonable axiomatization of arithmetic, could not prove all true arithmetic statements.</p>
<p>It already follows from the Lowenheim-Skolem theorems that there are uncountable models of the Peano axioms. Yes, there are uncountable structures in which induction holds! Let&#8217;s call the natural numbers the <em>standard</em> model of the Peano axioms and all other models <em>nonstandard</em>. An easy application of the compactness theorem shows that there are countable nonstandard models of the Peano axioms, or indeed of any collection of true arithmetic statements. Order-wise, these models look like the natural numbers followed by densely many copies of the integers: $\mathbb N$ followed by $\mathbb Q$-many copies of $\mathbb Z$ (see the <a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/04/introToPAModels.pdf" target="_blank">slides</a> for explanation).<br />
<a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/04/PAmodel.jpg"><img src="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/files/2015/04/PAmodel.jpg" alt="PAmodel" width="596" height="82" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2571" /></a><br />
Can we compute inside a nonstandard model of arithmetic? This question can be made precise in the following way. We can naturally think of elements of a countable nonstandard model as $\mathbb N\cup \mathbb Q\times\mathbb Z$. We already know how to add a natural number $n$ to a number $(p,m)$ sitting in some block $p\in \mathbb Q$: we get $(p,m+n)$. Is there a nonstandard model, where we would have an algorithm for figuring out $(p,m)\cdot n$, or even better $(p,m)+(q,n)$ and $(p,m)\cdot (q,n)$? But we cannot! Tennenbaum famously showed in 1959 that there is no countable nonstandard model for which there is an algorithm to compute any of the above (see this <a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/2012/01/18/an-iphone-app-for-a-nonstandard-model-of-number-theory/" target="_blank">post</a>). The proof boils down to the fact that every countable nonstandard model codes in some algorithmically undeterminable subset of the natural numbers and being able to compute $(p,m)\cdot n$ would give us an algorithm to determine which numbers are in that very complicated set. So finally we have that the natural numbers are unique in one sense, it is the only model of the Peano axioms in which we can compute. </p>
<p>There are continuum many non-isomorphic countable models of arithmetic and they have some remarkable properties. For instance, Friedman showed in 1973 [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_19">1</a>] that every countable nonstandard model of arithmetic is isomorphic to a proper initial segment of itself. Whatever happens in a nonstandard model of arithmetic has already happened before! Also, while the natural numbers obviously have no nontrivial automorphisms, there are countable nonstandard models with continuum many automorphisms. In particular, a nonstandard model of arithmetic can have <em>indiscernible</em> numbers that share all the same properties. Indeed, the automorphism groups of nonstandard models have some remarkable properties themselves (for details, see [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_20">2</a>]).</p>
<p>What are the nonstandard models of arithmetic good for? While GÃ¶del showed that there are true arithmetic statements that cannot be proved from the Peano axioms, the example he demonstrated is not something a number theorist would encounter in their everyday practice. Using the structure of nonstandard models of arithmetic, Kirby and Paris in the 1980s developed techniques to show that interesting purely number theoretic statements such as Goodstein&#8217;s theorem and the Paris-Harrington theorem cannot be proved from the Peano axioms [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_21">3</a>]. Maybe the day will come when we are able to show using nonstandard models of arithmetic that ${\rm P=NP}$ cannot be proved from the Peano axioms! Always nice to end on an impossible note.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I was driving up to Northeim to pick up some Sandkastensand (because people had actually cleaned out the other storeâs 150 25kg packs â are you kidding me). While in my car, I was listening to <a href="http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/schriftstellerin-susan-kreller-die-kinder-nicht-alleine.1202.de.html?dram:article_id=316765">this conversation on DLF</a>, featuring a writer notable for her childrenâs books. I didnât know her though Iâll try to get my hands on her collection of new translations of English poems (for children).</p>

<p>What struck me about the conversation was the nature of the discussion. I suppose a good example was a ever so slightly sharp turn in the conversation when it came to the translation of a Lewis Carroll poem which, in its new translation, featured a Porsche â an anachronism that met criticism from the host.</p>

<p>What caught my ear was how these two talked eye-to-eye, the host displaying in-depth knowledge not only of literature in general but the guestâs work in particular. This allowed them to discuss how the writer worked, the real essence of her work, the challenges, the modus operandi. (What also made me wonder was the precarity of the writer; the collection came out of her PhD work, the first book seemed only a success in so far as it landed her some prize/stipend that allowed her to write the second book. Literary careers always sound like scientific research careers, yet we keep things separated.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Iâve always yearned for the equivalent of an art critic (which the host evidently provided) but for math and science. One of my first blog posts ever was about mediocrity and, in may ways, critics are the perfect example of why mediocrity is [pun not averted] critical. Instead of pretending to pursue âhighâ art/science/math a critic is helping their field by providing constructive (and when necessary destructive) review. In public. We do not have this for STEM. Yet the discussion between those two was as esoteric to me as a discussion about forcing axioms or JavaScript libraries would be to them. Of course, German Feuilleton (oh my, I had no idea about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feuilleton">contemporary meaning in French</a>) assumes none of its work is esoteric but features 0% of real science criticism (let alone math).</p>

<hr />

<p>Skip back a few years. My only comment left on Carta.info (no link because I canât find it and because carta has become quite strange) was a foolish, troll-like comment (confirming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlonâs razor</a>, it was out of stupidity) where I wondered why <a href="http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/aktuelle-presseschau.354.de.html">DLFâs Presseschau</a> never included quotes from blogs, since I clearly had (and have) the impression political bloggers are on par with those strange, small-town newspapers that make it into that selection of op eds. (IIRC, thereâs now some minor tech segment on DLF that features some blog posts; oh well.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Over the past year I started to listen to more and more podcasts, primarily about web technology, i.e., work (it all started with the excellent <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shoptalkshow</a>). Listening to the conversation on DLF, I realized two things. First, technology podcasts provide just that criticism for web technology. While itâs often infantile, itâs equally often profoundly useful. As usual, web tech is trying to skip an old medium; a loss for both sides.</p>

<p>Still, during the DLF conversation yesterday I realized that I need to look for another kind of technology podcast: one about actual code. That is, where developers talk about their approach to programming, problem solving, how various tools do their job, and who knows, maybe even actively review code. In other words, a podcast that does for web tech what the DLF piece yesterday might do for writers. Maybe streaming things like twitch.tv (and perhaps livecoding.tv if it ever goes [pun not averted] live) will fill the gap naturally. Still, Iâll have to hunt around some time.</p>

<p>Thinking back to mathematics, the podcasts I tried do not fill that gap. There are really good ones out there but they are not on the level of that DLF conversation or on the level of technology podcasts. They always seemed to be more interested in news, puzzles etc rather than challenging the listeners and the experts alike. Which reminds me, I should try to pick up Vilaniâs book.</p>

<hr />

<p>Later it smelled like Sommerregen. And everything was well.</p>]]></summary>

<p><i>Abstract</i>: The classical LÃ³pez-Escobar theorem states that any Borel class of countable structures may be axiomatized using an appropriate infinitary logic. One application of this theorem is to relate topological and model-theoretic versions of Vaught&#8217;s conjecture. In this talk we present a variant of LÃ³pez-Escobar&#8217;s theorem for metric structures, which implies that Borel classes of separable metric structures may be axiomatized in the appropriate infinitary continuous logic. As a consequence we obtain a new implication between the topological Vaught conjecture and a version for metric structures. This is joint work with Martino Lupini.</p>]]></summary>

<p><strong>Â Title:</strong> A microscopic approach to Souslin trees constructions</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present an approach to construct $\kappa$-Souslin trees that is insensitive to the identity of the cardinal $\kappa$, thereby, allowing to transform constructions from successor of regulars to successor of singulars and to inaccessibles. This is obtained by redirecting all constructions through a parametrized proxy principle.<br />
The construction is carried as a transfinite sequence of microscopic steps that is indifferent of the &#8220;big picture&#8221;. Indeed, the features of the outcome tree are determined by the parameters of the proxy principle that one starts with.</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Justin</strong> <strong>Moore</strong>: The panel was chosen in an attempt to capture stuff in, around and after the<a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/12-13/forcing/index.html"> 2012 Forcing and its Applications Workshop</a> at the Fields. I feel they represent varying fields within set theory (although they were chosen somewhat arbitrarily). To start, let&#8217;s look at the following two questions:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Question 1</strong>: Comment on your vision of set theory.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Question 2</strong>: What should we be working on in the next 10 years?</p>
<p><strong>Stevo Todorcevic</strong>: I&#8217;ll repeat exactly what I said at BÄdlewo: It has to be about applications. More serious, deeper. Think about model thoery and the successes there. Even in this seminar we&#8217;ve had set thoery talk about topological dynamics, but it would be great if we could have the other direction: dynamics talking about set theory. Can infinite networks give discrete results?</p>
<p><strong>Christina Brech</strong>: This is Forcing *and its applications*&#8230; What does the future look like?</p>
<p><strong>ST</strong>: Hopefully forcing gives more ZFC results. Cardinal invariants should have more connections.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Moore</strong>: Jindrich? How do you feel about the questions?</p>
<p><strong>Jindrich Zapletal</strong>: I&#8217;m here for set theory of the reals. There are 2 parts. (1) We&#8217;re facing a major upcoming hurdle in the era of post-Shelah. We depend heavily on him. Remove him from the picture and we lose our leader. That era is not very far away. (2) Similar to Stevo. Shelah gave us creature forcing (which has a limited form of Ramsey theory). No one really understands it. Approximate Ramsey theory sounds like it is connected. It is proved in a different way, but should have some connection with creature forcing.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: Assaf?</p>
<p><strong>Assaf Rinot</strong>: There is a recent paper by Raghavan and Shelah where creature forcing is used to deduce consequences of Martin&#8217;s Axiom. Maybe this is part of the future. Let me explain. Forcing, i think, is more of a test for what we cannot prove. What we seek are canonical models. There is $L$, but it cannot accompany large cardinals, so, Woodin has a project for getting the &#8220;Ultimate $L$&#8221; that will be $L$-like, accompany the large cardinals, and be canonical in additional senses. In parallel, there are models of forcing axioms such as Viale&#8217;s $MM^{+++}$ that are saturated enough to also decide many mathematical statements. The Raghavan-Shelah approach fits into the latter.</p>
<p><strong>AR, continued </strong>: I believe that the working mathematician would be happy to know that there are (merely a few) &#8220;canonical models&#8221;, and in each one of them, they can carry their everyday mathematics, never bumping into the problem of deciding statements. Another line of investigation is of &#8220;canonical theories&#8221;, by which, I mean statements that are decided asymptotically. I&#8217;ve been personally after statements that hold in $L$, yet turned out to be outright provable from <strong>ZFC</strong>, or from <strong>ZFC</strong>+an obviously necessary hypothesis, like approximations of diamond and square. There&#8217;s also Shelah&#8217;s revised <strong>GCH</strong>. So, I&#8217;d say that the future would be canonical models and canonical theories.</p>
<p><strong>JZ</strong>: I like your use of plurals.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: Christina, how about your answers to the questions?</p>
<p><strong>CB</strong>: I already work in applications, so I&#8217;m glad to hear everyone likes applications.</p>
<p><strong>ST</strong>: I have a question for you Christina: There are great problems in Banach spaces and geometry. Is the separable quotient problem going to be solved in the next 10 years?</p>
<p><strong>CB</strong>: I hope so. We only exist so long as problems are being solved. Otherwise, it is hard to justify ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>ST</strong>: What about looking at other structures?</p>
<p><strong>CB</strong>: It&#8217;s unclear how much life Banach spaces have left. I also agree with ZFC being the direction&#8230; I think more directions have to be explored.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: One thing about set theorists is that we have the perspective of set theoretic tools. The Foreman-Weiss collaboration is a great example. They were just chatting about their research and they realized there was crossover. The perspective of descriptive set theory was used for Ergodic theory. Ultimately it was rather rudimentary set theory, but it was there. One of our big problems is that our tools are far too sophisticated for everyday problems.</p>
<p><strong>Matteo Viale</strong>: Try to make forcing appetizing . Forcing seems too special for other people to learn. People need to present it in an appetizing way. For example, look at homotopy theory. They presented less sophisticated methods in a way closer to how other people like. The first step is to direct forcing into homotopy theory.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: What do you mean? Do you have a specific thing in mind?</p>
<p><strong>MV</strong>: The Grothendick stuff. Semantics in Topos theory.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: So putting things in their language?</p>
<p><strong>MV</strong>: Yeah. We need to understand them. The second step is to do like model theory has done. E.g. Hrushovski. We should start to understand what the others are doing.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: I said inÂ BÄdlewo our biggest challenge is &#8220;to find applications while not giving up our identity as set theorists.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>ST</strong>: For example, Banach was a set theorist.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: I agree with the sentiments about model theory&#8217;s successes. We need to do better with our tools outside our own area. Maybe the first step is to make it more accessible so someone else can tell us where to direct our energies. We can focus more on applications as I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any danger of set theory becoming &#8220;too applied&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>CB</strong>: But the other danger exists (of becoming too isolated).</p>
<p><strong>MV</strong>: We are all agreed about applications.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: It&#8217;s surprising we all agree. It might be because the conference was about &#8220;applications&#8221;. Any questions from the audience?</p>
<p><strong>Osvaldo Guzman (Centro de Ciencias MatemÃ¡ticas)</strong>:Â  I think most fields don&#8217;t worry about whether they are applied or not.</p>
<p><strong>ST</strong>: There are lots of fields that worry.</p>
<p><strong>AR</strong>: They care about interactions with other fields.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: One anecdote I have that might be useful is about a colleague in complex analysis. Every year he asks his students to give a presentation on how their research is related to complex analysis. His world is so complex analysis centred that he sees connections everywhere. This is not a weird thing.</p>
<p><strong>MV</strong>: I think there is a lot of cross-breeding in other fields. This is a recent problem in set theory&#8230; We are in the corner. We have to change, not what we study, but how we pursue interaction.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: For example, my L-space proof was simplified because I sat in on a topology seminar and learned Kroenecker&#8217;s theorem. It wasn&#8217;t a breakthrough, but it certainly helped the proof become more readable.</p>
<p><strong>AR</strong>: You can do discrete mathematics all your life if you want, but I think that interaction with continuous objects will get you further. For<br />
instance, <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/14-15/forcing/abstracts.html#peng">Peng&#8217;s lecture from today</a> that centers around their construction of a Lindelof group whose square is not Lindelof. Any mathematician would admit it is a natural question. This group is obtained by taking Moore&#8217;s oscillation function (a discrete object), and plugging it into a relative of the sine function. This turned out to be a fruitful interaction, and it is unclear whether the result can be obtained without this interaction.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: Historically we have answered questions from other fields. Now we have to decide if we want to answer our own questions or those of other people.</p>
<p><strong>ST</strong>: It would be amazing if topological dynamics could talk about discrete mathematics. For example Furstenberg in the 70s with ergodic theory talking about Szemeredi&#8217;s Theorem. This is probably quite hard.</p>
<p><strong>Marcin Sabok (McGill University)</strong>: Some fields that don&#8217;t care about connecting is ones that are already attached to physics. We should try Computer Science, e.g. Automata. Some descriptive set theorists are already doing this. This like this require breakthroughs though. It&#8217;s hard, but other fields are connecting constantly. We have potential, e.g. ergodic theory, operator theory, but we can search for connections in other places.</p>
<p><strong>Erin Carmody (CUNY Graduate Center)</strong>: To a certain extent there is the analogy with the history of art. It started very practical with people painting what they saw. Then it moved into more abstract studies of colour. It has somewhat shifted back, but now people are better with colours. Specifically, as set theorists we are like the branch of artists which study colour, and this is our advantage to solving the open problems in all of the branches of mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>Sean Cox (Virginia Commonwealth University)</strong>: We hear about the successes on nonstandard analysis. What about nonstandard set theory?</p>
<p><strong>MV</strong>: We should look at nongeneric ultrafilters, e.g. $V[\mathcal{U}]$. This could link much easier with other fields. Another example would be names for complex numbers given by continuous real values functions and moding out by a filter (??)&#8230; Rings and germs are done a lot in other places, but we should do it more.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: Asymptotic Cones are a very mainstream thing in geometric group theory that involves ultrapowers and gives you nonseparable Polish spaces. Set theory should be able to say something about this. What&#8217;s the barrier to when the ultrafilter starts to influence things?</p>
<p><strong>Iian Smythe (Cornell University)</strong>: Undergrads aren&#8217;t expected to know what first-order logic is. Is this a problem?</p>
<p><strong>MV</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ST</strong>: Yes, and it is a political problem.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: We talk to our departments.</p>
<p><strong>Micheal Pawliuk (Univeristy of Toronto)</strong>: Of course this raises the natural question: What&#8217;s so special about us? Isn&#8217;t every field saying there&#8217;s is the one that should be taught?</p>
<p><strong>MV</strong>: This is important because as set theorists we are able to appreciate skepticism and provability. This is powerful.</p>
<p><strong>ST</strong>: The best students in our U of T logic courses are computer science students. This is unnatural.</p>
<p><strong>MS</strong>: Maybe we should make use of this?</p>
<p><strong>AR</strong>: Our colleagues don&#8217;t understand infinity. Maybe countable and the continuum, but not the difference between $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_2$. Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Bergfalk (Cornell University)</strong>: Look at &#8220;Utility of the uncountable&#8221; by Justin Moore. I think there is a false controversy with category theory about foundations. At some level, sure, but that&#8217;s not really what keeps us up at night. We&#8217;re really the study of the infinite, or uncountable. Indepence is a feature, not a bug. You can do mathematics without set theory, but it is an impoverished mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>MS</strong>: Pre-Cantor there was one infinity and two sizes (finite and infinite). Post-Cantor there seems to be three sizes: finite, countable and uncountable. We can blame Godel for this.</p>
<p><strong>AR</strong>: Again, how do we separate $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_2$ for our colleagues?</p>
<p><strong>SC</strong>: Closing off naturally leads to $\aleph_1$ and this is something people understand.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: We&#8217;ve been very successful as a field in the last 50 years. Compare with differential equations which is basically only about solving differential equations. There are still tools to be discovered about differential equations&#8230;. Independence is very scary outside of set theory&#8230; What has not been publicized is how successful we&#8217;ve been in independence. We basically have all the tools we will ever need with forcing and large cardinals.</p>
<p><strong>MS</strong>: This is also the problem as people think it is just applying the same technique over and over.</p>
<p><strong>JM</strong>: Isn&#8217;t differential equations just solving more and more differential equations?</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was my first day of teaching for the spring semester. I have a very different schedule this semester from last semester. Last semester, I had three courses, and I had requested that they be restricted to two days per week so that I wouldn&#8217;t have to come in as many days. In previous years at other institutions, that strategy had worked well to help me organize my time. However, I never taught more than two courses at once. Here at LaGuardia, teaching three long classes on the same day proved to be overwhelming, especially considering that I had to move my office hours to a third day and often ended up coming in a fourth day anyway to attend meetings, grade, prepare course materials, or do administrative work. </p>
<p>So I am happy that I have only one course each day this semester. I am teaching two courses this semester. Precalculus (Math 200) meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8AM, and Elementary Algebra (Math 96) meets on Mondays and Wednesdays at 9:15 AM. (Each class meets with me a total of five hours per week.) Then on Fridays I have the set theory seminar at 10AM at the Graduate Center, or occasionally a faculty seminar at LaGuardia at 9AM where we will prepare to teach a seminar for first year LaGuardia students. I think that will be cool, because I really enjoyed my first year seminar as an undergraduate student at Grinnell. </p>
<p>This morning schedule is a big change for me; I have been a total night owl for the last seven years at least, rarely getting up much before noon. But I think it will be good for my health to wake up more with the sun. It might be a rough adjustment period, but it will be worthwhile. As a bonus, if all goes well, I can leave work by mid to late afternoon most days and be able to go out in the city some weekday evenings for dinner or a show. (If all doesn&#8217;t go well, I&#8217;ll be buried in grading, course preparation, administrative work, etc. and rarely get out of here until late anyway. But I am optimistic that it will be better than that.) Another nice benefit to the schedule is that I can conveniently make myself available for 45 minutes worth of office hours four days per week, so that students have a better opportunity to see me.</p>
<p>The elementary algebra students seem like a good group. They really seemed to appreciate the activity of sharing their feelings towards math and their expectations for the course. The videos didn&#8217;t seem to be as effective; only a few students commented on them, but the initial discussion before the videos was quite fruitful. A few students told me that they hate math, but many, I think a majority though I didn&#8217;t count, came in with positive attitudes towards math. Now it is my responsibility to help them to maintain these positive attitudes and to work hard and succeed in the class. I&#8217;m up for the challenge. </p>]]></summary>

<p>It has always surprised me a little that the web â created at CERN by a trained physicist turned computer scientist â was born without much consideration for math and science. Of course, it isnât all that surprising since the original HTML lacked more basic things (such as support for tables or images). Either way, people did see the need early on and in 1995 <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/maths.html">the draft of HTML 3 proposed a <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> tag</a>, adding basic math support in HTML. Unfortunately, HTML 3 was rejected by browser vendors, and its more fortunate successor, HTML 3.2, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#HTML_versions_timeline">dropped the <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> tag</a> (among other things). As was the fashion of the time, the <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> tag was turned into a separate XML specification and within a year <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-MathML-19980407/">MathML was born</a>. Problem solved? Not quite.</p>

<p>MathML did turn out to be hugely successful in the XML world. Authoring and conversion tools quickly made MathML easy to create and edit while publishers adopted MathML in their XML workflows. The main reason was that MathML provided a robust, exchangeable, and reusable format for rendering and archiving equational content. However, XML did not succeed as much on the open web and the XML legacy made it difficult to use MathML in HTML itself. This meant that mathematics (and in extension scientific notation) remained a second-class citizen. Surprisingly, MathML did not simply fade away like other web standards but made a comeback in HTML 5, where we can now use like any other tag. Problem solved? Not quite.</p>

<p>Despite its success, its rich ecosystem, and its importance for research and education, MathML continues to struggle on the most critical front: browser adoption. So far, not a single browser vendor has actively developed their MathML implementation. While Internet Explorer and Chrome lack MathML support entirely, Firefox and Safari at least accepted code contributed by volunteers (and in Mozillaâs case actively supported the code base). To compensate, the <a href="http://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> project (disclaimer: which I work for) developed an open-source JavaScript solution that authors and publishers can easily drop into their content. MathJax renders MathML on the fly, providing high-quality output that works everywhere out of the box, using only web standards such as HTML and CSS. A joint venture of the <a href="http://www.ams.org">American Mathematical Society</a> and the <a href="http://www.siam.org">Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics</a> with the support from <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/#sponsors">numerous sponsors, including Wiley</a>, MathJax has become the gold standard for math on the web with our free CDN service alone registering 35 million daily visitors. Problem solved? Not quite.</p>

<p>While we are proud of our accomplishments at MathJax, we know that we can only provide half the solution: native browser support must be the goal. Only native browser support can make MathML universal, helping everyone and allowing people to push the envelope for math and science on the web further. I believe a crucial role lies with publishers. Taking a cue <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2011/11/30/now-every-company-is-a-software-company/">from Forbes</a>, now every publishing company is a web technology company. Not being involved in the development and implementation of web standards is a bit like printing books but not caring about literacy rates â if you build it, they still canât come! When it comes to the development of the web, scientific publishers can become the bridge between authors and standards bodies and they can be instrumental in supporting the development of tools and processes that push everyone forward. Problem solved? Not quite but if you build <em>this</em>â¦</p>

<p>The re-integration of MathML into HTML5 was a huge step towards math and science becoming first class citizens on the web. MathML is not only a fully accessible exchange format for mathematics but it is also part of other scientific markup such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Markup_Language">Chemistry Markup Language</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CellML">Cell Markup Language</a>. The future of MathML in browsers will determine the future of scientific markup on the open web. In the end, a chemical reaction or a data plot has no more reason to be a binary image than an equation â we need markup that is alive in the page and can adapt to the needs of the users. Only this will allow us to develop new forms of expressing scientific thought, forms that are leveraging the full breadth of the open web platform, that are truly native to this amazing medium called the web. And that would be an exciting problem to have.</p>

  <li>Kaveh Bazargan â¢ 23 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you Peter for your accurate and witty post, and thank you for MathJax which has served as a beautiful solution to math on the web. The lack of support from browsers has been pathetic and shameful, and you are right that the only real solution is that MathML (and other MLs) are supported natively supported as the definitive content. We should not really have to resort to âtricksâ such as MathJax, however well executed those tricks might might be!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peter Krautzberger re Kaveh Bazargan â¢ 23 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks, Kaveh. As I wrote, Firefox and Safari do have some support for MathML and of course MathJax is also not yet complete in its implementation (thereâs only so much room in a non-technical post).</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, itâs an achievable goal for a publisher to produce MathML that renders fine on Firefoxâs native support (while I donât think the same can be said about Safari at this point).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kaveh Bazargan Peter Krautzberger â¢ 23 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course in practice we simply cannot restrict users to browsers these days, so until there is native support of MathML in all popular browsers, weâll continue with MathJax which <em>does</em> work on all. ;-)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peter Krautzberger Kaveh Bazargan â¢ 23 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>Hereâs hoping that one day, we wonât have to. Wouldnât that be a nice problem to have?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Robert OâCallahan â¢ 23 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to get all browsers to support MathML natively is to push math users to use Firefox for its native MathML support. That will get the attention of the other browser vendors. Unfortunately, even in this post you didnât clearly commend Firefox for being the only browser with native MathML.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peter Krautzberger re Robert OâCallahan â¢ 23 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the comment, Robert. Iâm not sure who you have in mind with âusersâ. I would agree that authors should ensure that their MathML renders well on Firefox natively.</p>

<p>I wouldnât quite agree to call Gecko/Firefox the only browser with MathML support. WebKit/Safari made a lot of progress last year thanks to Fred Wangâs work even if itâs behind Firefox in its implementation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Robert OâCallahan re Peter Krautzberger â¢ 23 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>By âusersâ I mean people producing and viewing math content.</p>

<p>Iâm glad Safari is making progress. Feel free to recommend it too. The important thing is to create market pressure for browser vendors to implement native MathML, and that means users/developers choosing one browser over another because of MathML.</p>

<p>As you probably realize, MathJax being so good has actually reduced that pressure; itâs easy for browser vendors to say âhey, MathJax works fine in our browser, so why bother investing in native MathMLâ. Even in this post, you havenât clearly identified reasons why native MathML is better than MathJax fallback.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peter Krautzberger re Robert OâCallahan â¢ 22 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully agree that users should choose browsers for their features and Firefoxâs MathML support is, to me, a huge factor, especially in an educational setting. (In fact, I just recently had an interesting situation where I helped a student struggling with a school project about HTML that required some math â and naturally he chose MathML since they were using Firefox and he wasnât even aware of browser support issues â bliss ;-) ).</p>

<p>Iâve encountered the âMathJax is holding back browser implementationsâ argument a couple of times now and it feels like a Catch-22 to me. Without MathJax (I think) there wouldnât be significant amounts of MathML on the open web and thus no incentive to implement MathML support natively. Now, with MathJax, thereâs lots of MathML, yet thereâs still no incentive. I suspect the reasons lie elsewhere. (And from speaking to Gecko, WebKit and Blink developers it does not lie with the developers).</p>

<p>The reason why I didnât go into technical details about why native support is so important is that it didnât fit in this forum (both in length and audience). But youâre right that perhaps I should have tried better. Some basic notes can be found on my personal blog at http://boolesrings.org/krautzbâ¦</p>

<p>You and others here say MathJax isnât an adequate solution. But you donât explain why? It seems like a very successful project, and a far better approach from an software engineering perspective than native browser support.</p>

<p>Adding MathML support into every browser requires duplication of development effort and places responsibility for maintenance in the hands of browser vendor employees for whom MathML is neither a priority nor an area of expertise. Each implementation will vary in its performance, bugs and feature-set, and authors will need to know these differences in order to produce content that is compatible across all browsers. Future versions of the MathML spec will require development and deployment across all browsers, increasing the cost and delay in making new features available.</p>

<p>In contrast, keeping MathML support within a library allows development to proceed at its own pace, handled by those for whom it is both a priority and an area of expertise, and removes the cross-browser compatibility burden. MathML users then only have to deal with a single set of features and bugs, and can upgrade to newer versions of the library as and when they need to, instead of being beholden to browser development and upgrade cycles.</p>

<p>It seems like browser vendors would be better off concentrating on providing powerful, general low-level APIs for things like parsing, layout and rendering, in order to help the implementation and use of libraries like MathJax. That way, the web can scale to support custom rendering of not just MathML, but also Chemistry ML, Cell ML, and the many other useful markup languages and formats, while reducing the centralisation of effort and complexity within the browsers themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But you donât explain why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See my other comments on this.</p>

<p>As for the other points your raise, they seem to apply to any newer web standard so I donât quite see how theyâre relevant to MathML specifically.</p>

<p>But yes, certain low-level APIs could make MathML polyfilling much easier; no surprise there. However, their implementation seems even less likely â especially since some of them have been rejected in the past.</p>

<p>Besides, MathML is not rocket science. It adds a few basic constructs to HTML/CSS such as multiscripts, stretchy characters and better table alignments. If you look at Gecko and WebKit itâs clear that itâs not a huge burden to maintain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>JonRimmer re Peter Krautzberger â¢ 22 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>I donât see any concrete technical reasons in any of your other comments for the inadequacy of MathJax. Could you be more specific about which comments you mean?</p>

<p>As for other new web standards, you are absolutely right that same points apply to them. The web has to get away from the situation where features must be implemented natively in the browser in order to avoid feeling second-class. That is the only way the web will be able to regain competitiveness with native platforms like iOS and Android. As it stands, the web is losing ground quickly to these platforms, because the need to implement features natively results in an unacceptable bottleneck in innovation.</p>

<p>Fortunately, while there may have been resistance in the past to making low-level capabilities available to library authors, that is changing. For example, there W3C CSS Working Group has recently created the Houdini Task Force [1] which aims to design low-level APIs for parsing, layout, content fragmentation and font metrics. I am certain that they and others would be very interested in hearing what APIs would help in implementing MathJax and equivalent libraries. The Extensible Web Manifesto [2] also covers similar ground.</p>

  <li>Peter Krautzberger re JonRimmer â¢ 22 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks, Iâm well aware of Houdini and the extensible web manifesto and these are great initiatives with excellent people involved (such as Rob who commented here as well).</p>

<p>Personally, I think reports of the imminent death of the web are exaggerated. But even so, Iâd argue that abandoning important and established web standards will do nothing but speed that up.</p>

<p>As for the technical issues, they are (again) nothing particular to MathML. Polyfilling a textual rendering component â be it math or bidi or linebreaking â always happens too late in the game, i.e., after the page renders because good layout will depend deeply on the surrounding context. Similarly, inserting large amounts of content fragments (easily in the thousands) into the DOM will always come with issues, especially performance.</p>

<p>More importantly, relying on a polyfill will prevent universal use. Developers will always have to make a conscious decision to add support, adding complexity and risking instability. In reality, we could never expect to be able to use mathematics in something as basic as a webmailer or a social network.</p>

<p>The thing is: the âifâ is not even the problem. When you ask actual browser developers (be it Mozilla or Google or Apple or Microsoft) they in favor of MathML. The problem lies much more on the management side.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it comes down to how important mathematics is. (Why not kick bidi? SVG? flexbox? tables?)</p>

<p>The web is the most important medium for human communication and mathematics is one of the oldest and most universal forms of expression. Every school kid (worldwide) engages in mathematics (often for many years) and soon will do so in an HTML context. In particular, students will have to actively communicate (author, share, digest) mathematics and this will primarily happen on the web. To me, that makes it pretty important to have math natively on the web.</p>]]></summary>

<p><i>Abstract</i>: Continous logic is a proper generalization of first order logic where the usual binary truth values are replaced by the unit interval $[0,1]$. The models for this logic are metric structures, which are metric spaces together with continuous functions and $[0,1]$-valued relations. Just as ordinary logic has typical applications in discrete math, continuous logic has applications in analysis. In this talk we will introduce just the basic concepts and theory of continuous logic.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Laver famously defined and used a Laver function on a supercompact cardinal for the indestructibility argument showing that a supercompact cardinal can be made indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-directed closed forcing [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_28">1</a>]. Since then, Laver-like functions for various other large cardinals have played in a significant role in helping to lift embeddings in indestructibility arguments. They also possess inherent interest as guessing functions with strong affinity to the $\diamondsuit$ principle, that arise specifically in the context of large cardinals.</p>
<p>Suppose that $\kappa$ is some large cardinal that can be characterized by the existence of certain kinds of elementary embeddings. A Laver-like (partial) function  $\ell:\kappa\to V_\kappa$ roughly has the property that for every set $a$ in the universe, there is some embedding $j$ of the type characterizing the cardinal such that $j(\ell)(\kappa)=a$. In this sense, a Laver-like function can &#8220;guess&#8221; or anticipate any element of the universe as the image of $\kappa$ under some embedding $j$. Large cardinals that don&#8217;t have embeddings whose targets include arbitrarily large segments of the universe can have appropriately defined Laver-like functions that anticipate only elements of some  subset of $V$. If $\kappa$ is measurable, then there is an embedding $j:V\to M$ but $M$ is only guaranteed to include $H_{\kappa^+}$ of $V$. So it would only make sense for a Laver-like function for a measurable cardinal to anticipate elements of $H_{\kappa^+}$. On the other hand, because a supercompact cardinal has embeddings with targets that include arbitrarily large rank initial segments of $V$, its Laver function can anticipate any set in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: Suppose that $\kappa$ is supercompact. A <em>Laver</em> function $\ell:\kappa\to V_\kappa$ has the property that for every cardinal $\lambda$ and $a\in H_{\lambda^+}$, there is a $\lambda$-supercompactness embedding $j:V\to M$ (with $M^\lambda\subseteq M$) such that $j(\ell)(\kappa)=a$.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: Suppose that $\kappa$ is extendible. An <em>extendible Laver</em> function $\ell:\kappa\to V_\kappa$ has the property that for every cardinal $\alpha$ and $a\in V_\alpha$, there is $j:V_\alpha\to V_\beta$ with $j(l)(\kappa)=a$.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong>: Suppose that $\kappa$ is measurable. A <em>measurable Laver</em> function $\ell:\kappa\to V_\kappa$ has the property that for every $a\in H_{\kappa^+}$, there is $j:V\to M$ such that $j(\ell)(\kappa)=a$. </p>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong>: Suppose that $\kappa$ is strongly unfoldable. A <em>strongly unfoldable Laver</em> function $\ell:\kappa\to V_\kappa$ has the property that for every $a\in H_{\theta^+}$, there is a $\theta$-strong unfoldability embedding $j:M\to N$ (with $V_\theta\subseteq N$) such that $j(\ell)(\kappa)=a$.</p>
<p>Although, the existence of Laver-like functions can be forced for many large cardinals, only few large cardinals such as supercompact, strong, and extendible cardinals have them outright. A very general account of Laver-like functions for various large cardinals and where they exist or can be forced to exist appears in [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_29">2</a>]. For instance, not every strongly unfoldable cardinal has a strongly unfoldable Laver function because it is consistent that $\diamondsuit_\kappa({\rm REG})$ fails at a strongly unfoldable cardinal [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_30">3</a>], but every universe with a strongly unfoldable cardinal has a forcing extension in which it has a strongly unfoldable Laver function.</p>
<p>I will show that remarkable cardinals have Laver-like functions, which we call <em>remarkable Laver</em> functions. To motivate the definition of remarkable cardinals, introduced by Ralf Schindler, let&#8217;s consider the following theorem of Magidor giving an alternative characterization of supercompact cardinals in terms of <em>small</em> embeddings.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>: (Magidor, [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_31">4</a>]) A cardinal $\kappa$ is supercompact if and only if for every regular cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$, there is a regular cardinal $\overline \lambda<\kappa$ and  $j:H_{\overline\lambda}\to H_\lambda$ with critical point $\gamma$ such that  $j(\gamma)=\kappa$. 

Remarkable cardinals are <em>pseudo-supercompact</em> in the sense that a cardinal is remarkable if the embeddings characterizing a supercompact cardinal exist, not necessarily in $V$, but instead somewhere in $V$&#8217;s generic multiverse.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 1</strong>: A cardinal $\kappa$ is <em>remarkable</em> if for every regular cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$, there is a forcing extension $V[H]$ of $V$ having an embedding  $j:H^V_{\overline\lambda}\to H^V_\lambda$ for some $V$-regular $\overline\lambda<\kappa$, with critical point $\gamma$ and $j(\gamma)=\kappa$.

It is not difficult to show that this definition is equivalent to the standard definition of remarkable cardinals [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_32">5</a>] (see this <a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/2014/03/01/introduction-to-remarkable-cardinals/" target="_blank">post</a> for a more extensive introduction to remarkable cardinals).</p>
<p><strong>Observation 1</strong>: A cardinal $\kappa$ is remarkable if in the ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$ forcing extension $V[G]$, for every regular cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$, there is an embedding $j:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_\lambda^V$ for some $V$-regular $\overline\lambda<\kappa$, with critical point $\gamma$ and $j(\gamma)=\kappa$.

In order to prove observation 1, we need a lemma about the absoluteness of existence of embeddings of countable models, which was discussed in this <a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/2014/05/07/an-absoluteness-lemma-for-countable-embeddings/" target="_blank">post</a> and plays a central role in proving just about anything having to do with remarkable cardinals.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: (Absoluteness Lemma for countable embeddings) Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are transitive models of ${\rm ZFC}^-$ and $j:M\to N$ is an elementary embedding. If $W\subseteq V$ is a transitive (set or class) model of ${\rm ZFC}^-$ such that $M$ is countable in $W$ and $N\in W$, then $W$ has some elementary embedding $j^*:M\to N$. Moreover, if $\text{cp}(j)=\gamma$ and $j(\gamma)=\delta$, we can additionally assume that $\text{cp}(j^*)=\gamma$ and $j^*(\gamma)=\delta$. Additionally, we can assume that $j$ and $j^*$ agree on some fixed finite number of values.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of observation 1</strong>: The existence of some $j:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_\lambda^V$ for a sufficiently large $\lambda$ with $j(\gamma)=\kappa$, where $\gamma$ is the critical point of $j$, anywhere in the multiverse, implies that $\kappa$ is inaccessible.<br />
Suppose that $V[H]$ is some forcing extension of $V$ having an embedding $j:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_{\lambda}^V$ with critical point $\gamma$, $j(\gamma)=\kappa$, and $\overline\lambda<\kappa$. Let's argue that every ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$-forcing extension of $V$ has such an embedding $j^*$ as well. If we suppose not, then there is some condition $p\in {\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$ forcing that there is no such embedding. Let $G$ be any $V[H]$-generic for ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$ containing $p$. Then $H_{\overline\lambda}^V$ is countable both in $V[H][G]$ and its submodel $V[G]$ (since $\kappa$ is inaccessible, meaning that $H_{\overline\lambda}^V$ has size less than $\kappa$). Thus, by the absoluteness lemma, there is $j^*:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_\lambda^V$ in $V[G]$ such that $j^*(\gamma)=\kappa$. But this contradicts our assumption that $p\in G$ forces that no such embedding exists. $\square$

Now, let's define what is a remarkable Laver function.

<strong>Definition 2</strong>: Suppose that $\kappa$ is remarkable. We define that a function $\ell:\kappa\to V_\kappa$ is a <em>remarkable Laver</em> function if whenever $\lambda>\kappa$ is regular and $x\in H_\lambda$, then every ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$-forcing extension $V[G]$ has an embedding $j:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_{\lambda}^V$, where $\overline\lambda<\kappa$ is $V$-regular, critical point is $\gamma$, and $j(\gamma)=\kappa$, such that

<ol>
<li>
$\ell\upharpoonright\gamma+1\in H_{\overline\lambda}^V$,
</li>
<li>
$\gamma\in\text{dom}(\ell)$,
</li>
<li>
$j(\ell\upharpoonright\gamma+1)(\kappa)=x$.
</li>
</ol>
<p>We also require that for every $\xi\in\text{dom}(\ell)$, we have that $\xi$ is inaccessible and $\ell&#8220;\xi\subseteq V_\xi$. </p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong>: (Cheng, G.,  [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_33">6</a>]) Every remarkable cardinal has a remarkable Laver function.</p>
<p>For indestructibility results, the value of a remarkable Laver function lies in the following theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 3</strong>: (Cheng, G., [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_33">6</a>]) Suppose that $\kappa$ is remarkable and $\ell$ is a remarkable Laver function. In a ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$-forcing extension $V[G]$, for every regular cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$, there is an  embedding $j:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_\lambda^V$, where $\overline\lambda<\kappa$ is $V$-regular, $\gamma$ is the critical point, and $j(\gamma)=\kappa$, such that

<ol>
<li>
 $(\gamma,\overline\lambda]\cap \text{dom}(\ell)=\emptyset$,
</li>
<li>
$\ell(\gamma)$ is defined,
</li>
<li>
$j(\ell\upharpoonright\gamma)=\ell$.
</li>
</ol>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last fall, I noticed that a major problem for many of my students, especially my basic students, was a lack of motivation to study math. So I spent a few hours today looking for some motivational articles and videos on the topic. I plan to show this motivational material to students on the first day of class (the spring semester starts in the beginning of March at LaGuardia) and then have them discuss it. Here&#8217;s the best of what I found: two videos and one article. If any of my readers have additional suggestions for motivational material, I&#8217;d be very interested. I think it&#8217;s really important toÂ get students feeling motivated from the beginning of the semester.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of last year, I tried to motivate myself to write more so I set myself a <a href="http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger/2014/11/03/tiny-blogging-challenge/">tiny blogging challenge</a>: writeo one post each week for the remaining weeks of the year, donât spend more than for 30mins per post.</p>

<p>It didnât really work out but perhaps in a good way. Yes, I posted 7 out 8 weeks so thatâs close (still, Mike gets to name a charity of his choice). No, I most definitely did not spend just 30min per post (more like 1h, sometimes way moreâ¦). But those were means to an end which included a) try out something that gets me to write more regularly and b) make it interesting for my two readers, maybe add a third reader (crazy, I know!).</p>

<p>At the end of the year I was exhausted (so I had to take January off â well, be kind enough to pretend I did that intentionally and not simply failed to write that one last post for week 8). In part this was due to me writing on a couple of other, work-related places. I suppose one could say the blogging challenge helped there; e.g., it motivated me to finish a couple of outstanding blog posts on mathjax.org. But I think in reality it was the holidays and I had enough opportunity to write for a couple of hours (or sleep in to compensate).</p>

<p>As for the means, this exhaustion leaves me in doubt for the first one. Did I simply overdo it? Maybe I just need to pace myself better. Weâll see (thanks to Asaf for bugging me to get back on the wagon).</p>

<p>As for the second one, I think that was a bit of a miss. At least in the sense that my posts seemed to cause a lot of confusion and irritation. Then again, that was somewhat intentional, I just wasnât happy with the <em>kind</em> of confusion, perhaps.</p>

<p>As for 2015, I will try to pace myself better. First target: finish that post from the original list of the tiny blogging challenge.</p>

There. My one good deed for the year, I can get back to being an evil man once more (by forcing and tricking poor models of set theory to have no choice, of course).

Also, how did Mike win the friendly wager? He didnât post <em>anything</em> during that period. You should have won that after the first week, or second week.

<p><em>Abstract</em>: In this talk I&#8217;ll summarize my efforts to involve students in projects that replicate the math research experience. In particular I will discuss a set of projects and corresponding curriculum (adapted from another university) for Math 287. The projects require students to ask questions, formulate conjectures, investigate them in groups, and express their findings in writing. Investigations of this type are appropriate for students at the 200-400 level, and can easily become material for a senior thesis.</p>]]></summary>

        <updated>2015-01-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I&#39;m teaching via <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL), it is important to get student buy-in.  I often refer to this as &quot;marketing IBL&quot;.  My typical approach to marketing involves having a dialogue with my students, where I ask them leading questions in the hope that at the end of our discussion the students will have told me that something like IBL is exactly what we should be doing.  </p>

<p>In the past, I would just wing it on day one and it&#39;s been different every time. However, I&#39;ve had lots of people ask me to describe exactly what I do and I also thought it would be a good exercise for me to sit down and think carefully about the activity.  So, in the fall of 2014, I created some slides to guide the activity, which I am now calling &quot;Setting the Stage&quot;.  Since then I have shortened the activity and made some improvements. The current version of the activity is inspired by <a href="http://theronhitchman.github.io">TJ Hitchman</a>, <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/starbird/">Mike Starbird</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/thewordninja_bk">Brian Katz</a>.</p>

<p>The main idea is that I want to get students thinking about why we there and what we should really be striving to get out of the course.  In addition, it helps students understand why I take an IBL approach in my classes. Below is an outline of the the activity.</p>

<h2 id="directions-to-the-students">Directions to the Students</h2>

<ul>
<li>Get in groups of size 3â4.</li>
<li>Group members should introduce themselves.</li>
<li>For each of the questions that follow, I will ask you to:

<ol>
<li>Think about a possible answer on your own.</li>
<li>Discuss your answers with the rest of your group.</li>
<li>Share a summary of each groupâs discussion.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li> ï¿¼What are the goals of a university education?</li>
<li> How does a person learn something new?</li>
<li> What do you reasonably expect to remember from your courses in 20 years?</li>
<li> What is the value of making mistakes in the learning process?</li>
<li> How do we create a safe environment where risk taking is encouraged and productive failure is valued?</li>
</ol>

<p>Each time I&#39;ve run the activity, the responses are slightly different.  The responses to the first two questions are usually what you would expect.  Question 3 always generates great discussions.  The idea of &quot;productive failure&quot; naturally arises when discussing question 4 and I provide them with this language sometime while discussing this question.  Listening to the students&#39; responses to question 4 is awesome. It&#39;s really nice to get the students establishing the necessary culture of the class without me having to tell them what to do.</p>

<p>After we are done discussing the 5 questions, I elaborate on the importance of productive failure and inform that I will often tag things in class with the hashtag #pf in an attempt to emphasize its value.  I also provide them with the following quote from <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/starbird/">Mike Starbird</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Any creative endeavor is built on the ash heap of failure.â</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrap up the activity by conveying some claims I make about education and stating some of my goals as a teacher.</p>

<h2 id="claims">Claims</h2>

<ul>
<li>An education must prepare a student to ask and explore questions in contexts that do not yet exist. That is, we need individuals capable of tackling problems they have never encountered and to ask questions no one has yet thought of.</li>
<li>If we really want students to be independent, inquisitive, &amp; persistent, then we need to provide them with the means to acquire these skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lofty-goals">Lofty Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transition students from consumers to producers!</li>
<li>I want to provide the opportunity for a transformative experience.</li>
<li>I want to change my studentsâ lives!</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is the Spring 2015 version of the slides that accompany the activity.</p>

<p>Solovay and TennenbaumÂ <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0294139">proved</a> that Martin&#8217;s Axiom is consistent with $2^{\aleph_0}&gt;\aleph_1$.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0505492">[Sh:80]</a>, Shelah proved that the following weak generalization of Martin&#8217;s Axiom is consistent with $2^{\aleph_1}&gt;\aleph_2$ and CH. <strong>If</strong> $\mathbb P$ is a partial order satisfying:</p>
<ol>
<li>$|\mathbb P|&lt;2^{\aleph_1}$;</li>
<li>$\mathbb P$ is $\sigma$-closed;</li>
<li>$\mathbb P$ is $\aleph_2$-stationary-c.c.: if $\{ p_\alpha\mid\alpha&lt;\aleph_2\}$ is an injective enumeration of conditions, then there exists a regressive map $f:\omega_2\rightarrow\omega_2$ and a club $D\subseteq\omega_2$, so that $\{ p_\alpha\mid \alpha\in D\cap E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}, f(\alpha)=i\}$ is directed for all $i&lt;\omega_2$;</li>
<li>well-met condition: for every $p,q\in\mathbb P$, if $\{ r\in\mathbb P\mid p\le r\ \&amp;\ q\le r\}$ is nonempty (i.e., $p$ and $q$ are compatible), then the set has a least element,</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>then</strong> for any family $\mathcal D$ of $&lt;2^{\aleph_1}$ many dense subsets of $\mathbb P$, there exists a directed subset $G$ of $\mathbb P$ such that $G\cap D\neq\emptyset$ for all $D\in\mathcal D$.</p>
<p>Let us look at requirements (1)&#8211;(4).</p>
<p>Requirement (1) is a rather natural restriction (though, this restriction may sometime be waived via tail-catching, or by reflection arguments in the presence of large cardinals).</p>
<p>Requirement (2) has to do with the fact that any forcing axiom for meeting more than $\aleph_1$ many dense sets which will be compatible with CH, will have to be applicable only to forcing notions that do not add reals.</p>
<p>Requirement (3): Recall that Martin&#8217;s Axiom implies that the product of any two c.c.c. posets is again c.c.c., whereas there are ZFC examples of two $\aleph_2$-c.c. posets whose product is not anymore $\aleph_2$-c.c. (seeÂ <a href="http://blog.assafrinot.com/?p=3755">here</a>). So, plain $\aleph_2$-c.c. must be replaced by a stronger variation.</p>
<p>Today, I learned from Ashutosh Kumar that <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4042">[Sh:1036]</a> offers a nice and relatively simple justification ofÂ Requirement (4). Luckily, the example builds upon a <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1623206">theorem</a> of Shelah which I already presented in a <a href="http://blog.assafrinot.com/?p=2073">previous blog post</a> (see also Section 2 of this <a href="http://blog.assafrinot.com/?p=448">survey paper</a>, for motivation):</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Shelah).</strong> If $\langle C_\delta\mid \delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}\rangle$ is a sequence such that $C_\delta$ is a club in $\delta$ of order-type $\omega_1$ for each $\delta$, then there exists a sequence of local colorings $\langle f_\delta:C_\delta\rightarrow2\mid \delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}\rangle$, such that for every global coloring $f:\omega_2\rightarrow\omega_2$, there exists $\delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$ for which $\{ \alpha\in C_\delta\mid f(\alpha)\neq f_\delta(\alpha)\}$ is <strong>not</strong> bounded in $\delta$.</p>
<p>The very same <a href="http://blog.assafrinot.com/?p=2073">proof</a> shows that &#8220;not bounded&#8221; may be strengthened to &#8220;is stationary&#8221;. Thus, fix a sequence $\langle f_\delta\mid \delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}\rangle$ witnessing the latter. For simplicity, we may assume that $\min(C_\delta)=1$ for all $\delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$. Define a notion of forcing $\mathbb P$, as follows. $p\in\mathbb P$ iff it is a <strong>partial</strong> function from $E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$ to $\mathcal P_{\omega_1}(\omega_2)$, such that:</p>

<p>Let $\mathcal D:=\{ D_{\alpha,\delta}\mid \alpha&lt;\delta, \delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}\}$, where $$D_{\alpha,\delta}:=\{ p\in\mathbb P\mid \delta\in\text{dom}(p)\ \&amp;\ \max(p(\delta))&gt;\alpha\}.$$</p>
<p>Then $|\mathcal D|=\aleph_2$ and if $G$ happens to be a directed subset of $\mathbb P$ such that $G\cap D$ for all $D\in \mathcal D$, then for all $\delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$, $c_\delta:=\bigcup\{ p(\delta)\mid p\in G\}$ is a club subset of $C_\delta$, and $f:=\bigcup\{f_\delta\restriction c_\delta\mid \delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}\}$ is a function! In particular, $\{\alpha\in C_\delta\mid f(\alpha)\neq f_\delta(\alpha)\text{ or }\alpha\not\in\text{dom}(f)\}$ is <strong>nonstationary</strong> for all $\delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$.</p>
<p><strong>Claim 1.</strong> $D_{\alpha,\delta}$ is dense for every $\delta\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$ and $\alpha&lt;\delta$.<br />
<strong>Proof.</strong> Given $q\in\mathbb P\setminus D_{\alpha,\delta}$, we distinguish two cases.<br />
If $\delta\in\text{dom}(q)$, then let $\alpha&#8217;:=\min(C_\delta\setminus(\max(q(\delta)\cup\{\alpha\})+1))$, and set $$p:=(q\restriction(\text{dom}(p)\setminus\{\delta\}))\cup\{(\delta,q(\delta)\cup\{\alpha&#8217;\})\}.$$If $\delta\not\in\text{dom}(q)$, let $t:=\bigcup\{ C_\beta\cap C_\gamma\mid \beta\neq\gamma\text{ in dom}(q)\cup\{\delta\}\}$. As $t$ and $\text{dom}(q)$ are countable, it is easy to construct an <strong>injective</strong> sequence $$\langle \alpha_\beta\mid \beta\in \text{dom}(q)\cup\{\delta\}\rangle\in\prod_{\beta\in \text{dom}(q)\cup\{\delta\}}C_\beta$$ such that $\alpha_\beta&gt;\sup(q(\beta)\cup(t\cap\beta))$ for all $\beta\in\text{dom}(q)$, andÂ $\alpha_\delta&gt;\sup(\alpha\cup(t\cap\delta))$.<br />
Finally, let $p\in\mathbb P$ be such that $\text{dom}(p)=\text{dom}(q)\cup\{\delta\}$ and, $$p(\beta)=\begin{cases}q(\beta)\cup\{\alpha_\beta\},&amp;\beta\in\text{dom}(q)\\\{\alpha_\delta\},&amp;\text{otherwise}\end{cases}. \square$$</p>
<p><strong>Claim 2.</strong> $\mathbb P$ is $\sigma$-closed.<br />
<strong>Proof.</strong> Given an increasing sequence $\langle p_n\mid n&lt;\omega\rangle$ in $\mathbb P$, define $p\in\mathbb P$ such that $\text{dom}(p):=\bigcup_{n&lt;\omega}\text{dom}(p_n)$ and $p(\delta)$ is the closure of $\bigcup\{p_n(\delta)\mid n&lt;\omega, \delta\in\text{dom}(p_n)\}$ for all $\delta\in\text{dom}(p)$. To see that $p\in\mathbb P$, we only need to verify that if $\delta_1&lt;\delta_2$ are in $\text{dom}(p)$ and $\alpha\in p(\delta_1)\cap p(\delta_2)$, then $f_{\delta_1}(\alpha)=f_{\delta_2}(\alpha)$. Fix a large enough $N&lt;\omega$ such that $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ are in $\text{dom}(p_N)$. Put $\beta:=\sup(C_{\delta_1}\cap C_{\delta_2})$, then $\beta&lt;\delta_1&lt;\delta_2$, and by clause (4) above, $\beta&lt;\max(p_N(\delta_i))$ for $i&lt;2$. By $\alpha\in C_{\delta_1}\cap C_{\delta_2}$, we have $\alpha\le\beta&lt;\max(p_N(\delta_i))$ for $i&lt;2$. As $ p_n(\delta_i)$ end-extendsÂ  $p_N(\delta_i)$ whenever $N\le n&lt;\omega$ and $i&lt;2$, we infer that $\alpha\in p_N(\delta_1)\cap p_N(\delta_2)$, and so by Clause (3), $f_{\delta_1}(\alpha)=f_{\delta_2}(\alpha)$. $\square$</p>
<p><strong>Notation.</strong> For every $q\in\mathbb P$, denote $$g_q:=\bigcup\{ f_\delta\restriction q(\delta)\mid \delta\in\text{dom}(q)\}.$$</p>
<p><strong>Claim 3.</strong> CH entails that $\mathbb P$ has size $\aleph_2$ and satisfies the $\aleph_2$-stationary-c.c.<br />
<strong>Proof.</strong> It is a basic counting argument that shows that CH entails a bijection $\psi:\omega_2\leftrightarrow\mathbb P$. Next, given a sequence of conditions $\langle p_\alpha\mid\alpha\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}\rangle$, we first extend each $p_\alpha$ to a condition $q_\alpha$ satisfying $\alpha\in\text{dom}(q_\alpha)$, and $\max(q_\alpha(\delta))&gt;\alpha$ for all $\delta\in\text{dom}(q_\alpha)$ above $\alpha$.Â  As $g_{q_\alpha}$ is a countable partial function from $\omega_2$ to $2$, we infer from CH and the <a href="http://blog.assafrinot.com/?p=2054">Engelking-Karlowicz theorem</a> the exisetnce of a sequence $\langle \varphi_i:\omega_2\rightarrow2\mid i&lt;\omega_1\rangle$ such that for each $\alpha\in E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$, there is $i_\alpha&lt;\omega_1$ with $g_{q_\alpha}\subseteq \varphi_{i_\alpha}$. Let $D$ be the set of all $\delta&lt;\omega_2$ such that for all $\alpha&lt;\delta$, $\{ p\in\mathbb P\mid \text{dom}(p)\subseteq\alpha\}\subseteq \psi[\delta]$. Then $D$ is a club, and for all $\delta\in D\cap E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$, $\{ p\in\mathbb P\mid \text{dom}(p)\subseteq\delta\}\subseteq \psi[\delta]$. Define a function $h:E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}\rightarrow\omega_2$ by stipulating $h(\delta):=\sup(\bigcup\{\text{dom}(q_\alpha)\mid\alpha\in E^\delta_{\omega_1}\})$, and let $E:=\{\delta\in D\mid h[\delta]\subseteq\delta\}$. Finally, define a regressive function $f:E\cap E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}\rightarrow\omega_1\times\omega_2$ by letting $f(\delta):=(i_\delta,\psi^{-1}(q_\delta\restriction\delta))$.</p>
<p>To see that $\{ p_\alpha\mid \alpha\in E\cap E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}, f(\alpha)=i\}$ is directed for all $i\in\omega_1\times\omega_2$, fix arbitrary $\delta_1&lt;\delta_2$ in $E\cap E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$ with $f(\delta_1)=f(\delta_2)$.Â  As $q_{\delta_1}\restriction\delta_1=q_{\delta_2}\restriction\delta_2$ and $\delta_1\in\delta_2\in E$, we have $$q_{\delta_1}\restriction(\text{dom}(q_{\delta_1})\cap\text{dom}(q_{\delta_2}))=q_{\delta_2}\restriction(\text{dom}(q_{\delta_1})\cap\text{dom}(q_{\delta_2})).$$</p>
<p>Set $p:=q_{\delta_1}\cup q_{\delta_2}$. Then $p(\alpha)$ is a closed bounded subset of $C_\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in\text{dom}(p)$. Also, $g_p$ is a function, since $g_p\subseteq\varphi_{i_{\delta_1}}=\varphi_{i_{\delta_2}}$. So, $p$ satisfies Clauses (1)&#8211;(3) above. Now, as in the end of the proof of Claim 1, it is easy to find $p&#8217;\in\mathbb P$ with $\text{dom}(p&#8217;)=\text{dom}(p)$ such that $p'(\alpha)$ is an end-extension of $p(\alpha)$ by a singleton for all $\alpha\in\text{dom}(p&#8217;)$. Clearly, $p&#8217;$ is stronger than $q_{\delta_1}$ and $q_{\delta_2}$, let alone $p_{\delta_1}$ and $p_{\delta_2}$. $\square$</p>
<p>Note that any condition $p\in\mathbb P$ admits $\mathfrak c$ many pairwise incompatible extensions, hence, CH is also necessary for $\mathbb P$ to satisfy the $\aleph_2$-c.c.</p>
<p><strong>Claim 4.</strong> $\mathbb P$ does not satisfy the <em>well-met</em> condition.<br />
<strong>Proof.</strong> By iterating the pressing down lemma, we can find a stationary subset $S$ of $E^{\omega_2}_{\omega_1}$ along with ordinals $\alpha_0&lt;\alpha_1&lt;\alpha_2$ such that for all $\delta\in S$, the first three elements of $C_\delta$ are $\{\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\alpha_2\}$. Pick $\delta_0&lt;\delta_1$ from $S$. Let $p_i:=\{(\delta_i,\{\alpha_i\})\}$ for $i&lt;2$. Then $p_0$ and $p_1$ are compatible elements of $\mathbb P$, but due to Clause (4) above, $p_0\cup p_1$ is not in $\mathbb P$, and so the set $\{ r\in\mathbb P\mid p_0\le r\ \&amp;\ p_1\le r\}$ does not admit a least element. $\square$</p>

<p>Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma asserts that if an element $b$ in a model $M$ of Peano arithmetic (${\rm PA}$) is definable from another distinct element $a$, then the types of $a$ and $b$ in $M$ must be different. This lemma first appeared in a short paper of Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_40">1</a>], who used it to argue that if a model of ${\rm PA}$ is the Skolem closure of a single element $a$, then $a$ is the only element of its type; consequently, such models have no non-trivial automorphisms. Since that time, Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma has become ubiquitous in the study of models of ${\rm PA}$. In light of the extensive transfer of model-theoretic techniques from models of ${\rm PA}$ to models of set theory, we find it extremely natural to inquire whether Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma holds for models of set theory.</p>
<p>The initial answer is that Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s original argument succeeds directly in models of $V={\rm HOD}$, and more generally, it applies to the ordinal-definable elements of any model of set theory. Nevertheless, we prove that the lemma does not hold in all models of ${\rm ZFC}$, and it definitely fails in the forcing extension obtained by adding a generic Cohen real.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
If $a$ is ordinal-definable in a model of set theory $M\models{\rm ZF}$ and $b$ is definable from $a$, with $b\neq a$, then $a$ and $b$ satisfy different types in $M$. Consequently, Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma holds fully in models of $V={\rm HOD}$.
</li>
<li>
 Meanwhile, Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma does not hold in all models of set theory. Specifically, if $M$ is any model of ${\rm ZFC}$, then in the forcing extension $M[c]$ to add a Cohen real $c$, there are inter-definable elements $a\neq b$ with exactly the same type in $M[c]$. Indeed, there are such elements $a$ and $b$ with ${\rm tp}^{M[c]}(a/M)={\rm tp}^{M[c]}(b/M)$, meaning that $a$ and $b$ satisfy all the same formulas even with parameters from the ground model $M$.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Generalizing these observations, we shall introduce the parametric family of principles ${\rm EL}(A,P,Q)$, which holds for a model of set theory $M$ if whenever $a\in A$ and $b$ is definable in $M$ from $a$ using parameters in $P$, with $b\neq a$, then the types of $a$ and $b$ over $Q$ in $M$ are different. So in short, ${\rm EL}(A,P,Q)$ can be expressed by the slogan that <em>$P$-definability from $A$ implies $Q$-discernibility</em>. It might be of interest in general to also specify a set $B$ that $b$ has to belong to, but for our present purposes, this is not needed. Usually, the crucial case is that $a$ and $b$ come from the same collection, because if they don&#8217;t, then they can be distinguished for that very reason, at least for the classes $A$ that will be of interest to us.</p>
<p>These principles unify several natural variations of Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma that one finds in set theory. The principle ${\rm EL}(M,\emptyset,\emptyset)$, for instance, expresses the original Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma itself, and we have just mentioned in the theorem above that the principle ${\rm EL}({\rm OD}^M,\emptyset,\emptyset)$ holds in every model of set theory, while  the principle ${\rm EL}(M,\emptyset,{\rm On}^M)$ fails in any model $M$ obtained by forcing to add a Cohen real. The principle ${\rm EL}(M,M,{\rm On}^M)$ expresses in a model $M$ of set theory that any two distinct elements of $M$ can be distinguished by some formula with an ordinal parameter, which is the Leibniz-Mycielski axiom (see [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_41">2</a>]). The principle ${\rm EL}(M,M,\emptyset)$ holds for a model $M$ if any two distinct elements of $M$ have distinct types, which is precisely the property of $M$ being <em>Leibnizian</em> (see [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_42">3</a>]).</p>
<p>Lastly, we shall explore the relationship between definability and algebraicity, and variations of Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma which arise by using algebraicity in place of definability. Specifically, as in [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_43">4</a>], a set is algebraic in a parameter if it belongs to a finite set definable from that parameter. We show that Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma holds on all ordinal-algebraic sets if and only if the ordinal-algebraic sets and the ordinal-definable sets coincide, and we also settle several open questions that were asked in [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_43">4</a>] by pointing out that there are models of set theory in which there are algebraic sets that are not ordinal definable and there are models of set theory in which there are objects that are internally but not externally algebraic. Finally, we shall also investigate the algebraic versions of Ehrenfeucht&#8217;s lemma, the principles ${\rm AEL}_{\text{ext}}(A,P,Q)$ and ${\rm AEL}_{\text{int}}(A,P,Q)$, which state that if $b$ is (externally/internally) algebraic in $a$ using parameters from $P$, with $b\neq a$, then the types of $a$ and $b$ in $M$ over $Q$ are different &#8212; in short, <em>$P$-algebraicity from $A$ implies $Q$-discernibility</em>.</p>

Equivalently, there exists a sequence $\langle f_\alpha:\alpha\rightarrow\alpha\mid \alpha\in S\rangle$ such that $\{\alpha\in S\mid f\restriction\alpha=f_\alpha\}$ is stationary for every function $f:\kappa\rightarrow\kappa$.</p>
<p>It is clear that $\diamondsuit(S)$ implies $\diamondsuit(T)$ whenever $S\subseteq T\subseteq\kappa$. Shelah <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0469757">proved</a> that it is consistent that $\diamondsuit(S)$ holds, and at the same time $\diamondsuit(\omega_1\setminus S)$ fails, for some stationary co-stationary subset $S$ of $\omega_1$. Somewhat complimentary to the latter, Devlin <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0491194">proved</a> that if $\diamondsuit(\kappa)$ holds, then there exists a sequence $\langle S_i\mid i&lt;\kappa\rangle$ of pairwise disjoint subsets of $\kappa$ such that $\diamondsuit(S_i)$ holds for each $i&lt;\kappa$.</p>
<p>Devlin&#8217;s gem has two surprising features. The first feature is that &#8212; for an unclear reason &#8212; many people are unaware of Devlin&#8217;s finding.<br />
The second surprising feature is that Devlin&#8217;s proof is not entirely trivial:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Devlin defines the ideal $ND(\kappa)$ of all subsets $S$ of $\kappa$ on which $\diamondsuit(S)$ fails, proves that it is $\kappa$-complete (via Kunen&#8217;s trick for proving that $\diamondsuit^-(S)$ entails $\diamondsuit(S)$), and recalls that a $\kappa$-complete prime ideal on $\kappa$ cannot be second-order definable. Altogether, $ND(\kappa)$ is not $\kappa$-saturated.</p>
<p>In this short post, I&#8217;ll give a sincerely trivial proof.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Devlin&#8217;s gem.</strong> Let $\langle f_\alpha:\alpha\rightarrow\alpha\mid \alpha&lt;\kappa\rangle$ be s.t. $G(f)=\{\alpha&lt;\kappa\mid f\restriction\alpha=f_\alpha\}$ is stationary for every function $f:\kappa\rightarrow\kappa$. Write $S_i:=\{\alpha&lt;\kappa\mid f_\alpha(0)=i\}$ for all $i&lt;\kappa$. For every $\alpha&lt;\kappa$, let $g_\alpha:=\bigcup\{ f_{f_\alpha(\beta)}\mid 0&lt;\beta&lt;\alpha\}$.</p>
<p>We claim that $\langle g_\alpha\mid \alpha\in S_i\rangle$ witnesses $\diamondsuit(S_i)$ for each $i&lt;\kappa$. To see this, let $i&lt;\kappa$ and $f:\kappa\rightarrow\kappa$ be arbitrary.<br />
Define $g:\kappa\rightarrow\kappa$ by letting $g(0):=i$, and $g(\beta):=\min(G(f)\setminus\beta)$ whenever $0&lt;\beta&lt;\kappa$. As $G(g)$ is a stationary subset of $S_i$, it suffices to show that $f\restriction\alpha=g_\alpha$ for all limit $\alpha\in G(g)$. Let $\alpha\in G(g)$ be a limit ordinal. Then for all nonzero $\beta&lt;\alpha$, $g(\beta)=f_\alpha(\beta)&lt;\alpha$, and hence $f\restriction\beta\subseteq f_{f_\alpha(\beta)}\subseteq f\restriction\alpha$. That is, $g_\alpha=f\restriction\alpha$. $\square$</p>
<p>Note that the same proof shows that if $\diamondsuit(T)$ holds, then there exists a sequence $\langle S_i\mid i&lt;\kappa\rangle$ of pairwise disjoint subsets of $T$ such that $\diamondsuit(S_i)$ holds for each $i&lt;\kappa$.</p>
<p>Note also that unlike Devlin&#8217;s proof, the above proof does not build on the fact that $\kappa$ may be partitioned into $\kappa$ many pairwise disjoint stationary sets.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The most common choice principle for classes used in second-order set theory is the <em>choice scheme</em>, which states that if for every set $a$, there is some class $A$ witnessing a given second-order property, then there is a single class coding a witness for the set $a$ on the slice indexed by $a$. The choice scheme is used to show, for instance, that ÅoÅ&#8217;s Theorem holds for internal second-order ultrapowers and that first-order quantifiers don&#8217;t affect the second-order complexity of a property. We show that Kelley-Morse set theory (${\rm KM}$), one of the strongest second-order foundations, does not prove the choice scheme even for first-order properties. We also separate some natural fragments of the choice scheme by showing that the set-sized choice scheme, which allows only set many choices, cannot prove the choice scheme for first-order properties, and that the parameterless choice scheme, which does not allow parameters in the definition of a property, cannot prove the choice scheme for $\Pi^1_2$ properties. Finally, we argue that ${\rm KM}^+$, the theory ${\rm KM}$ together with the choice scheme, is a better foundation for second-order set theory than ${\rm KM}$. We show that among the weaknesses of ${\rm KM}$ is that a second-order ultrapower of a ${\rm KM}$ model may not even be a ${\rm KM}$ model and that first-order quantifiers are allowed to affect the second-order complexity of a property. This is joint work with Thomas Johnstone and <a href="http://jdh.hamkins.org/" target="_blank">Joel David Hamkins</a>.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[This is week 7 of the challenge but really a post to make up for dropping the ball on week 5.]</p>

<iframe width="854" height="510" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-uZL3qqDVK8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><a href="/0175/">Last week</a> I wrote about why I care about MathML in general. Given that I work for a project that serves as a MathML polyfill, itâs worth while to to point out why native implementations matter; they matter an entire alot of mattering.</p>

<p>A while back, <a href="http://www.milowski.com/">Alex MiÅowski</a> asked me for some quotes about how native MathML implementations are important so luckily I can copy myself here.</p>

<h4 id="its-important">Itâs important.</h4>

<p>Some people say, âfew people on the web need MathML support.â This is true. Just like saying âfew people need childrenâs clothingâ.</p>

<p>Why is MathML important? Education, education, and education. Mathematics is a core skill and a vast amount of educational time and effort is spent on teaching children and adults to understand and apply math &amp; science. Very soon, HTML will be the dominating delivery method for educational content across the world. This means mathematics must be HTML, viz. MathML.</p>

<h4 id="html-rendering-should-be-native">HTML rendering should be native</h4>

<p>Where should HTML rendering be implemented? In the browser!</p>

<p>MathML has been HTML from its inception and after a (forced) XML-detour, MathML is back where it belongs: a part of HTML5. MathML layout is core HTML functionality, widely used in everything from web communities to professional publishers to educational startups. HTML and thus MathML rendering belongs in the browser.</p>

<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>

<p>While browser vendors show great interest in enabling polyfills to behave like native implementations, polyfills implementing layout standards (MathML, Flexbox etc), in the end, will not achieve native performance. The reason is simple: layout polyfills simply enter too late in the game â after the browser layout is done, at a point where the user expects content, not additional rendering delays. Mooreâs Law helps a little but, ultimately, performance issues will prevent math and science from fulfilling their potential on the web.</p>

<h4 id="robustness">Robustness</h4>

<p>Even the most advanced polyfilling technology will remain a JavaScript solution. This increases the risk of problematic interactions with regular scripts for design, user interaction, and styling. Native support will always be more robust for web developers and consumers.</p>

<h4 id="ubiquity">Ubiquity</h4>

<p>Even the most ideal polyfill will require a conscious choice of the web developer to load it. This poses a grave restriction for end users and the emergence of new platforms for math and science on the web. From webmailer, to web based authoring, to social networks, all of these could turn out to be highly productive platforms â but itâs unlikely their developers will consider adding a polyfill for a perceived niche. With native MathML rendering, rendering MathML would be universal.</p>

<h4 id="the-future">The Future</h4>

<p>The web has revolutionized how we communicate. Not by magic but because thought leaders continually push the envelope, building new tools and platforms that transform how we work, speak, and think. These innovations feed back into standards development, enabling everyone to benefit and restarting the process, pushing us further.</p>

<p>MathML 3 captures traditional mathematical typography. Thanks to polyfills, we get a glimpse of how MathML might develop, how it can revolutionize the communication and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Yet without native implementations of MathML 3, we will never see MathML 4, 5, or 10, and the opportunities this will open up.</p>

<p>It took 50 years from Gutenbergâs printing press to the first typeset mathematics book. Weâre 25 years into the web. Do we wait another 25 years or can browser vendors finally invest 1-2 developer years to get us there?</p>

<hr />

<p>Update.</p>

<p>First, I changed the embedded video; it was previously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wHZHSt1CSgo#t=600">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Second, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeterKrautzberger/posts/3zdytApQw6N">over on Google+</a>, Harald Hanche-Olsen asked about the claim that MathML is a huge success. Hereâs what I responded with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Re success of MathML. Today, almost all equational content is stored as MathML. This is because almost all scientific (including mathematical) publishers have switched to XML workflows for production and archival where MathML fits in very naturally; similarly most technical writing (e.g., aerospace) is done in XML workflows.</p>

  <p>For authoring, itâs a bit more complicated. It is similar to, e.g., vector graphics where applications such as Adobe Illustrator have their own formats but when you save vector graphics for re-use youâll most likely export to SVG.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned, thereâs definitely the need for a professional-grade, open source pure MathML editor (ideally HTML5). The only one I know of is MathFlow. But if you have ever used MathJax then you have authored MathML â itâs how MathJax works: convert any input to MathML and then leverage our MathML rendering engine.</p>

  <p>Similarly, lots of other tools are able to output MathML â besides converters from TeX (such as LaTeXML or tex4ht), Microsoft Word Equation editor can export to MathML, as does Open Office Math editor, MathType, MathMagic, the Windows Math Input Panel (handwriting recognition), MyScript (ditto), Maple, Mathematica and virtually any other tool you might have authored serious equational content in. (Oh well, I shouldâve simply linked to http://www.w3.org/Math/wiki/Tools#Authoring_tools which I recently set up.)</p>

  <p>Of course, Word is the big reason why most scientific and educational content ends up providing MathML. I donât claim (or believe) that people are aware of most of this which was one of the reasons I wrote about it.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[This is week 6~7? Mpf, I missed one (and a half?), bummer. Iâll try to make up for it.]</p>

<p>When I started this writing challenge, I had listed a couple of potential blog post titles. One of them was âWhy you should care about MathMLâ. I realized later that I really didnât want to pretend I could even try to tell my two readers what they should or should not care about. Instead, I want to jot down (remember: 30mins time limt) a few reasons why I started to care about MathML, <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.de/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">alot</a>.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, it was in many ways a story of my education. Here are two quotes from yours truly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think MathML is so far the best solution to present mathematical content on the web  <br />
 â <a href="/0002/">actually me</a>, Dec. 2009</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, more stuff wrong on my post; also, referencing Terry Taoâs blog, weird.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But mathml sucks [â¦]  <br />
 â <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/#comment-2489">also actually me</a>, Feb. 2011</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(In my defence, I probably meant authoring tools and browser support.)</p>

<p>So as you can see, I flip-flopped a bit there (and, in a fundamentally different way, I still do). So here are five short reasons why I care about MathML.</p>

<h3 id="a-stable-exchange-format">a stable exchange format</h3>

<p>When I started using MathJax on a personal blog (thanks to the above quote I realize I started blogging <a href="http://thelazyscience.blogspot.de/2009/12/welcome.html">5 years ago this month</a>, (<a href="/0001/">local copy</a>), although I think I started to blog a year ealier on scivee.tv (though this seems lost)), I was first annoyed and then very happy to not use macros. Obviously, you can use macros with MathJax but I started to avoid personalized macros at all costs. Ultimately, they prevented me from writing mathematics elsewhere and they limited re-use of my writing by other people (well, ok, thatâs more hope than reality I suppose).</p>

<p>MathML does not suffer any of these complications (well, technically Content MathML could if anyone used it). Instead, MathML provides a truly stable format for storing equational content while still allowing for re-use. Granted, itâs not exactly easy to write by hand but neither are SVG or HTML/CSS (certainly not as soon as you want to express something more complex). Still, Iâd encourage anyone to spend some time with it (e.g., try copy-editing a random piece of MathML and compare that to copy-editing some macro-filled LaTeX horror). In any case, creating MathML is straight forward, especially for those knowing LaTeX syntax (even if we could use a a good open-source MathML editor). Ultimately, MathML is more readable in isolation thanks to its nature of being actually a mark-up language and not a programming language.</p>

<h3 id="a-focus-beyond-research">a focus beyond research</h3>

<p>What struck me early on was how successful MathML was outside of research. Research mathematicians (and scientists) tend to think their habits are vital for the longevity of mathematical writing. However, technical writing (such as industrial (think aerospace) documentation), engineering, and most importantly school-level mathematics are arguably more important â and have benefited enormously from a mathematical markup that is easily handled by researchers and non-researchers alike. MathML has brought high quality rendering together with easy authoring to an incredibly wide and diverse community; a huge accomplishment.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-for-real">accessibility, for real</h3>

<p>What I also learned early on (in crass contrast to my 2009 self above) was that MathML has turned out to be critical for having truly accessible mathematics.</p>

<p>Of course, TV Ramanâs AsTeR voiced TeX/LaTeX long before MathPlayer, ChromeVox or VoiceOver voiced MathML. But besides the refinements (which later tools could so easily provide), the notion of accessibility stretches far beyond voicing and visually impaired users. Features like synchronized highlighting would be much harder in TeX (just think about identifying subexpressions in a complex TeX macro, let alone in poorly authored TeX) but they are critical for helping people with learning or physical disabilities. Even more advanced features like summarization and semantic analysis are much more straight forward in a markup language like MathML than in TeX. And so is search whose importance can hardly be overstated in times of ever increasing publication pressure; without search mathematical knowledge wonât be accessible to us in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="the-dom-etc">the DOM (etc)</h3>

<p>The main reason why MathML is irreplaceable on the web is its compatibility with the DOM. This allows web developers to apply the full breadth of their tools to make mathematical content truly native instead of copying print-based layout. We cannot re-invent everything as Knuth did because web âtypographyâ is far from finished and communicating on the web will probably change drastically every couple of years for the foreseeable future (just like communicating using the printing press did in another age). Having a naturally fitting technology allows mathematics to continually evolve its expression alongside other forms of expression on the web â an incredible benefit (and challenge!).</p>

<h3 id="an-open-future-to-revolutionize-how-we-speak-mathematics">an open future to revolutionize how we âspeakâ mathematics</h3>

<p>This leads me straight to the last and probably main reason why I care for MathML. What the web has already done for regular language (all over the world), it can do for the language of mathematics: transform the way we communicate; expand, enhance, deepen, and lighten the way we express mathematical thought. You donât have to be Bret Victor to believe that in 30 years we will have developed new forms of expressions that truly leverage web technology and eliminate baroque limitations of black-and-white, print layout. We should strive to do so much better and I believe MathML is an important step in this direction.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[This is week 4 of the challenge. woohoo.]</p>

<p>Today I only have ~15 min. This week, I happen to be in Chicago for <a href="http://dotAstronomy.com/six">dotAstronomy 6</a>. This might be odd since Iâm not an astronomer (nowhere near in fact). It is actually an immense privilege, though, since Iâm part of a small group of invited interdisciplinary participants (also including biologists, climate scientists and library scientists). So my perspective is that of an outsider and I hate to admit it: itâs what I suspected all along.</p>

<p>That is, ever since running into the dotAstronomy website a few years ago, I have been a little envious. I kept thinking âThis sounds incredibly fantastic. How could we do something like this for mathematics?â Until today I could at least pretend that it couldnât actually be as great as it appears. Because nothing is, right?</p>

<p>My two readers wonât be surprised to hear it: I was wrong. dotAstro is every bit as exciting, enlightening, creative, and savvy as I had hoped. A fantastic group of scientists from all walks of scientific life, including ârecoveringâ researchers who have been led to non-standard careers while retaining a deep, nay fierce enthusiasm for their field as well as for the untapped potential offered to scientific communities by the web. This first day has been a perfect mix, starting with excellent talks, switching to amazing lightning talks, followed by an exhausting-because-engaging unconference sessions, and finally some great conversation at the pub (including perfectly greasy US bar food).</p>

<p>Luckily, I donât have to bore you with my notes but can simply point you to the <a href="http://dotastronomy.com/blog/2014/12/astro-6-live-blog-day-1/">live-blogging of the first day</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/vrooje">@vrooje</a>. In case my notes go up in flames, I could probably reconstruct half of it from the Twitter hashtags of the unconference sessions I attended, i.e.,</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hackj?src=hash">#hackj</a> (hack the journal)</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/astrocult?src=hash">#astrocult</a> (identifying dotastro culture)</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dotmuse?src=hash">#dotmu</a> (make science museums better)</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dotall?src=hash">#dotall</a> (reach out to all audiences)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now Iâm exhausted but excited for tomorrowâs hack day.</p>

Two questions:<br />
1) Did you only have 15 minutes because two weeks ago it took more than 30 minutes?<br />
2) Do you think that the fact that two people have commented on the content of your blog means that this has exhausted your reader base? If so, what sort of Alot would you imagine is useful here?<br />
Finally, I agree that this could be great in math. But it could also end up being counterproductive. Since mathematics can be a very non-applied form of art, rather than science with basis and application to/from all sort of fields like astronomy (all types of physics, some chemistry, all sort of engineering), this means that we get quite a fragmented result. Sort of like having Kandinski paint one half of a picture, cover it all but one inch, and letting Gogen paint the other hand accordingly. It just wonât click most of the times, but when it does it will be awesome.<br />
What exactly do I mean? If you take someone working in differential geometry, there might not be much that they can say about combinatorial properties of successor of singular cardinals to a set theorist, and vice versa. So youâd have to work âin the middle of fieldsâ where set theory and category theory meet, and differential geometry and constructive mathematics perhaps already wait for them. But now, since weâre talking about mathematics and mathematicians, we canât expect everyone to be familiar with all the fields, or accept handwavy, sketchy arguments (because those will almost always fail when actually writing them down for the first time), so lengthy tutorial needs to be given first.<br />
Because mathematicians, and foremost Lady Mathematics, like precision and like accuracy. And you canât just do that out of thin air.<br />
Of course, Iâm not advocating against this idea. I think itâs great, if you can find the right people. Namely, a bunch of mathematicians from different fields which have a common core interest, and can either put the additional time in learning the basics of the other participantsâ fields, or somehow be okay with handwaving until you slightly levitate, and of course have an open mind for these sort of things. Then sure, you can put them all together and let them talk about something, and almost surely something good can come out of it!<br />
(And it seems that Iâve mistaken the comment field for my own blog. ALOT! :-))</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[week 4 of the challenge. Itâs time for a quick post to catch up after last weekâs delay.]</p>

<p>As you know, this blogging challenge of mine is based on the observation that I would like to write more. And then Jeff Atwood reminds me in <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/because-reading-is-fundamental-2/">this interesting piece</a> that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we badly need to incentivize listening</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which makes me wonder if my natural tendency to let things brew for ages might not be a good thing. This blogging challenge will invariably show if Iâm actually able to write in decent quality under tighter constraints. (Right now, Iâm not so sure.) So perhaps I will have to realize that silence is golden.</p>

<p>On a related note, in recent months, I was forced to think about my comment âpolicyâ. This hadnât really come up before since I get very few comments and even fewer from strangers. But I think I should point out that nobody leaving a comment should expect said comment to be posted. Similary, nobody should expect a comment that has been posted to stay up (especially if gets posted automatically after Iâve allowed a comment in the past). Finally, nobody should expect me to reply to a comment even if Iâve replied to other comments and even if that happened in the same thread.</p>

<p>This policy has very little to do with trolling, actually, but more with off-topic comments and comments on ancient posts documenting how things have changed (Iâm so surprised! not). Itâs also related to a different point: Iâm probably switching off automated comments at some point next year (ooooooh, something will change, hint hint).</p>

<p>The number of worthwhile comments I get is roughly 1 per month (vs 5-10K of spam). So instead of a comment sytem, Iâll figure out some way you can quickly send me a comment and then I will add it manually. This move is not just laziness about dealing with spam (it will be slightly more work, I suspect) but also reflects the fact that I consider your comments to be additions to the content, not separate from it. This does not mean that a comment needs to be serious, of course â silly comments are just as (more?) (more!) relevant to me, so I hope people will keepâem coming.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Comments</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Asaf Karagila</strong>, 2014/12/02<br />
Silly comments are my specialty. As are most form of off topic. I think that I would have managed to squeeze the 45 minutes I have to teach into an actual 45 minutes time frame if I would lay off the off topic comments and jokes to my classroom.<br />
However, I do feel that humor is an integral part of my teaching, so I wonât do that, and Iâll keep the usual five minutes overtime.<br />
Hey, look at that, Iâm the first half of a soccer game! :)

        <updated>2014-11-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On October 12th, I saw <a href="https://plus.google.com/115742208154874814350/posts/CdNRDrUXFyy">a post</a> by <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DanChristensen/posts">Dan Christensen</a> on <a href="https://plus.google.com">Google+</a> about a list of <a href="http://www.cheswick.com/ches/conway1000.pdf">five open problems</a> posed by the mathematician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a> that have monetary rewards associated with them.  In particular, Conway is offering $\$1,000$ for solutions (either positive or negative) to any of the problems. Here are the five problems (as stated by Conway):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Problem 1.</strong> Sylver coinage game (named after Sylvester, who proved it terminates): The game in which the players alternately name positive integers that are not sums of previously named integers (with repetitions being allowed). The person who names 1 (so ending the game) is the loser. The question is: If player 1 names 16, and both players play optimally thereafter, then who wins?</li>
<li><strong>Problem 2.</strong> 99-Graph: Is there a graph with 99 vertices in which every edge (i.e., pair of joined vertices) belongs to a unique triangle and every nonedge (pair of unjoined vertices) to a unique quadrilateral?</li>
<li><strong>Problem 3.</strong> The Thrackle Problem: A doodle on a piece of paper is called a thrackle if it consists of certain distinguished points called spots and some differentiable (i.e., smooth) curves called paths ending at distinct spots and so that any two paths hit once and only once, where hit means having a common point at which they have distinct tangents and which is either an endpoint of both or an interior point of both. The right hand figure shows a thrackle with six spots and six paths. But can a thrackle have more paths than spots?</li>
<li><strong>Problem 4.</strong> Dead Fly Problem: If a set of points in the plane contains one point in each convex region of area 1, then must it have pairs of points at arbitrarily small distances?</li>
<li><strong>Problem 5.</strong> Climb to a Prime: Let $n$ be a positive integer. Write the prime factorization in the usual way, e.g., $60 = 22 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$, in which the primes are written in increasing order, and exponents of 1 are omitted. Then bring exponents down to the line and omit all multiplication signs, obtaining a number $f(n)$. Now repeat.So, for example, $f(60) = f(22 \cdot 3 \cdot 5) = 2235$. Next, because $24235 = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 149$, it maps, under $f$, to 35149, and since 35149 is prime, it maps to itself. Thus, $60 \to 2235 \to 35149
\to 35149$, so we have climbed to a prime, and we stop there forever. The conjecture, in which I (Conway) seem to be the only believer, is that every number eventually climbs to a prime. The number 20 has not been verified to do so. Observe that $20 \to 225 \to 3252 \to 223271 \to \cdots$, eventually getting to more than one hundred digits without yet reaching a prime.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you solve one of these, you can reach Conway by sending snail mail (only) in care of the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University.</p>

<p>Around the same time that I stumbled onto these problems, I was brainstorming ideas for a couple of upcoming talks that I was slated to give (one for undergraduates and one for high school students).  I decided that discussing open problems with monetary rewards with an emphasis on Conway&#39;s problems would likely make for a nice talk.  Here is the abstract that I settled on for both talks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a history of individuals and organizations offering monetary rewards for solutions, either in the affirmative or negative, to difficult mathematically-oriented problems. For example, the Millennium Prize Problems are seven problems in mathematics that were stated by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000. A correct solution to any of the problems results in a $\$ $1,000,000 prize being awarded by the institute. To date, only one of the problems has been solved (the PoincarÃ© Conjecture was solved by Grigori Perelman, but he declined the award in 2010). These are hard problems! The renowned mathematician John Conway (Princeton) maintains a list of open problems and for each problem on the list, he is offering $\$ $1000 to the first person that provides a correct solution. In this talk, we will explore a few of Conwayâs problems, and in the unlikely event we come up with a solution, weâll split the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Friday, October 24, 2014, I gave <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dcernst/open-problems-with-monetary-rewards">a talk</a> during the Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar (FAMUS) at NAU.  Speaking at FAMUS is always fun and my talk seemed to be well-recieved.</p>

<p>After having a practice run during FAMUS, I was able to improve the slides I intended to use during my talk at the <a href="http://nau.edu/CEFNS/NatSci/Math/Department-Activities/High-School-Math-Day/">2014 NAU High School Math Day</a>, which took place a few days later on Tuesday, October 28, 2014.  Here are my slides:</p>

</div>

<p>I had a blast presenting to the high school students.  It cracked me up that there were a few students that immediately started obsessing over the Sylver coinage problem and likely didn&#39;t hear a word I said after that.  My goal was to give an engaging and high energy talk.  I also slid in some humor and I was happy that everyone laughed when they were supposed to.  Interestingly, the thing I said that the students thought was the funniest was something that I didn&#39;t intend to be humorous.  When I stated that &quot;If you solve one of these, you can reach Conway by sending snail mail (only) in care of the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University,&quot; the audience burst into laughter.  Requiring snail mail seemed so ridiculous to them, they thought it was a joke.</p>

<p>As a side note, I used <a href="https://github.com/matze/mtheme">mtheme</a> (available for free on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>) together with beamer/LaTeX to generate my slides.  I&#39;m really happy with the look of mtheme and thrilled to get away from the standard beamer themes.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Last year I wrote a guide for students taking the University of Toronto&#8217;s big (2000 student) first year calculus class MAT135. It was so successful that I wrote another guide to MAT137, the more specialized first year calculus class. Let me share them with you:</p>

<p>Hello Mike. I am a first year student at UTM and well, the transition from laid back high school to high demanding UTM has been an extreme shock to me as one would expect. Mat 135 is the math course I ended up taking(trying for CS).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to thank you for the post you made 10 months ago.</p>
<p><a class="imgScanned" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1rsa52/math_how_to_succeed_in_mat_135136/">http://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1rsa52/math_how_to_succeed_in_mat_135136/</a></p>
<p>Finding that post made me change my outlook in university and I have made myself a schedule to follow, which would focus on me doing eight hours on a course per week. So far it has been immensely helpful(but goddamn its exhausting). While I can&#8217;t ask you about other courses since you were a Mat 137 instructor, I can still ask you about 135 and general questions.</p>
<p>1) Any study habits I should try and pick up in general? While I have no issue just brute forcing a study session for a subject for an hour and then switching to another one, I get tired much faster that way.</p>
<p>2) For 135, sometimes I would come across a rare situation in which I would have to use something I&#8217;ve never done before(such as an obscure identity or a completely weird way of solving). This method never appears again and I&#8217;m left wondering &#8220;Do I have to know that?&#8221; Is it better to learn it anyway or spend time on the general practice?</p>
<p>3) Regarding the post you made, you wrote down that you devote 8 hours a week for each course for a total of 40 hours. Is this just the bare minimum or a limit to keep your sanity in check? I imagine the latter since I&#8217;m still transitioning from high school(extremely painful experience), but I want to make sure.</p>
<p class="bylink">Again, thank you for taking the time to answer these. I know you must get a lot of these, so it means a lot to get a response.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad that the post was helpful for you!</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999"><em>So far it has been immensely helpful(but goddamn its exhausting).</em></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad that you&#8217;ve set yourself a plan. Be sure to avoid burning out though. Make sure that you still make occasional time to see friends, go for walks, exercise, see a play, etc.. Your physical, mental and social health is important to being a good student. In moderation you will find yourself being more productive (and less stressed out) with these things. Exercise in particular is important.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #999999">Any study habits I should try and pick up in general? While I have no issue just brute forcing a study session for a subject for an hour and then switching to another one, I get tired much faster that way.</span></em></p>
<p>Try adding some variation to your studying. Maybe some days you do 1 hour Math, 1 Hour Chem, 1 Hour Econ, and then a different day you do 2 sets of 30 min Math-30min Chem-30 min Econ, and then a different day you do one chunk of 3 hours of math, the next day 3 hours of Chem, the next day 3 hours of Econ.</p>
<p>Shortening the study time will help you maintain focus, but longer sessions will allow you to go deeper into the material.</p>
<p>As for study habits, find what works for you; we&#8217;re all a bit different. If you find that you&#8217;re getting distracted a lot, turn off your phone and get a program like <a class="imgScanned" href="http://getcoldturkey.com/">Cold Turkey</a>.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #999999">For 135, sometimes I would come across a rare situation in which I would have to use something I&#8217;ve never done before(such as an obscure identity or a completely weird way of solving).

<p>In general I would say focus first on the main methods, then as you master those then you can start to think about the &#8220;tricks&#8221;. Think of it like a baker: you need to spend most of your time learning how to bake cakes, but you need to know a little bit about decorating them, and as you perfect the actual baking of the cake you can work on making your decoration fancier and fancier.</p>
<p>Maybe keep a list of tricks for individual problems written down somewhere.</p>
<p>Also, as you progress and get a deeper understanding of calculus you will find that some of these &#8220;tricks&#8221; aren&#8217;t really tricks at all, but the natural way to proceed. This takes time and experience though, so keep looking at this list of tricks as you progress through the course to see if you have any new insight.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a hard rule, it&#8217;s just meant to give you the impression that university should feel like a full time job (which is 40 hours a week). Some students tend to think that they&#8217;re university life should be filled with <em>just</em> attending classes and cramming before the midterm (which leads to disaster).</p>
<p>If you manage to keep to your schedule of 40 hours a week, you will do great!</p>

<p>Late reply, but I wished to put your post into practice and see the results for myself before messaging you. <strong>The result of following your advice? Perfect on the Proofs Midterm, almost perfect on the CS midterm, and a 87% on the 135 test while the average was 40%.</strong> I really don&#8217;t know how to thank you, and I seriously hope that future students will see your advice and put it into practice because it is a godsend.

<li>Put in your time. Time management is the key to success to university as I have found out.</li>
<li>Follow that post to the T.</li>
<li>Make yourself a schedule for the day, and follow it out.</li>
<li>Complete 40 hours every week, while also accounting for things such as midterms. This way you will have defined free time for yourself and still study well for everything. <strong>I have gone from doing average in high school to being &#8216;that guy&#8217; in Calculus and my other courses all thanks to time management.</strong></li>

<p>That&#8217;s what I would probably tell to future students(which I will be doing anyway since my high school called me up for a presentation). <strong>Honestly, everything in that post contributed not only to my Calculus mark but generally everything</strong>.

<p>Thanks for the post, if only it was more known. I think I should send it to my prof since he&#8217;s going to be mad at the class once it comes time to present total averages. Good luck with the job applications.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is motivated by a really great paper of Wojciech Guzicki from the 1970s entitled &#8220;On weaker forms of choice in second-order arithmetic&#8221; [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_46">1</a>] that I recently stumbled on while trying to trace the history of choice principles in second-order set theory (for the <a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/2014/07/30/choice-schemes-for-kelley-morse-set-theory/" target="_blank">choice schemes over Kelley-Morse</a> project). Guzicki asks whether the choice scheme is equivalent to the parameter-free choice scheme (keep reading for definitions) over the second-order arithmetic theory ${\rm Z}_2$. He goes on to prove that it is possible for the parameter-free choice scheme to hold, while the choice scheme fails for a $\Pi^1_2$-assertion. <span id="more-2344"></span> First, a brief background.</p>
<p>Second-order arithmetic studies structures with two types of objects: numbers and sets of numbers (which we can think of as the reals). It is formalized in a <em>two-sorted</em> logic, which has variables and quantifiers for the primary objects, and then separate variables and quantifiers for objects that are supposed to represent collections of primary objects. By convention, lowercase letters are used for primary objects and uppercase letters for their collections. A model $\mathcal M=\langle M,+,\dot,<,0,1,\mathcal S\rangle$ of second-order arithmetic is a model of first-order arithmetic $\langle M,+,\dot,<,0,1\rangle$ together with a collection $\mathcal S$ of subsets of $M$. Axiomatizations of second-order arithmetic generally consist of ${\rm PA}$ (Peano Arithmetic) for the first-order part together with axioms specifying which sets of numbers must exist (as well as whether induction holds for formulas with second-order quantifiers). So for instance, the theory ${\rm WKL_0}$ states that any collection of numbers recursive in a set in $\mathcal S$ is also in $\mathcal S$, and whenever a set in $\mathcal S$ codes an infinite binary tree, there is another set in $\mathcal S$ coding a path through this tree. Another example is the theory ${\rm ACA_0}$, which states that any collection that is first-order definable from parameters in $\mathcal S$ is itself in $\mathcal S$. I am mainly interested in one of the strongest theories of second-order arithmetic: ${\rm Z}_2$ (because it is the arithmetic analogue of ${\rm KM}$). The theory ${\rm Z}_2$ has full comprehension and full induction, meaning that any collection (second-order) definable from parameters in $\mathcal S$ is itself in $\mathcal S$, and induction applies to all second-order formulas. If $V$ is a universe of ${\rm ZF}$ (but not necessarily choice), then its $P(\omega)$ gives a model of ${\rm Z}_2$.

The <em>choice scheme</em> in second-order arithmetic is a choice principle which asserts for every second-order formula $\varphi(n,X,Y)$ that whenever $\forall n\,\exists X\,\varphi(n,X,A)$ holds, then there exists a collecting set $Z$ of witnesses such that $\forall n\varphi(n,Z_n,A)$ holds (where $Z_n$ is the set appearing on the $n^{\text{th}}$-slice of $Z$). More technically</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
$\forall n\,\exists X\,\varphi(n,X,A)\rightarrow\exists Z\,\forall n\,\varphi(n,Z_n,A).$
</p>
<p>The theory ${\rm Z}_2$ proves the choice scheme for $\Sigma^1_2$-assertions, but an instance of the $\Pi^1_2$ choice scheme fails in the model of ${\rm Z}_2$ given by $P(\omega)$ of the Feferman-LÃ©vy model of ${\rm ZF}$ [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_47">2</a>]. The <em>parameter-free</em> choice scheme simply disallows parameters in $\varphi$.</p>
<p>Now back to Guzicki&#8217;s paper. Because the paper was written at the time when forcing techniques were not yet fully developed, the forcing construction used to separate the parameter-free choice scheme from the choice scheme is not easy to understand. So instead of delving into the details, I made a guess that the argument should work by considering a symmetric submodel of the forcing extension by the product of the collapses of the first $\omega_1$-many cardinals (over $L$). The argument I give below seems to be significantly simpler than the argument of the paper, which makes me very suspicious of whether it is actually correct. So I decided to write this post and hopefully get some feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> There is a model of ${\rm Z}_2$ in which the parameter-free choice scheme holds but the choice scheme fails for a $\Pi^1_2$-assertion.<br />
<strong>Proof:</strong> We work in $L$ and force with the countable support product</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
$\mathbb P=\Pi_{\alpha<\omega_1}{\rm Coll}(\omega,\omega_\alpha)$
</p>
<p>to collapse the first $\omega_1$-many cardinals of $L$ to $\omega$. Let&#8217;s say that an automorphism $\pi$ of $\mathbb P$ <em>respects coordinates</em> if there are automorphisms $\pi_\alpha$ of ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\omega_\alpha)$ for $\alpha<\omega_1$ such that whenever $\langle p_\alpha\mid\alpha<\omega_1\rangle\in\mathbb P$, then $\pi(p)=\langle \pi_\alpha(p_\alpha)\mid\alpha<\omega_1\rangle$. Let $\mathcal G$ be the group of all coordinate respecting automorphisms of $\mathbb P$. Let $\mathcal F$ be the filter on $\mathcal G$ generated by the sets $E_\alpha$, where $E_\alpha$ is the collection of all coordinate respecting automorphisms $\pi$ such that $\pi_\beta$ is identity for all $\beta<\alpha$. Note that $\mathcal F$ is normal: if a subgroup $\mathcal H\in \mathcal F$ and $\pi\in \mathcal G$, then $\pi H\pi^{-1}$ is in $\mathcal F$ as well. Define the symmetry group of a $\mathbb P$-name $\sigma$, ${\rm sym}^{\mathcal G}(\sigma)$ to be the collection of all $\pi\in \mathcal G$ such that $\pi(\sigma)=\sigma$. If ${\rm sym}^{\mathcal G}(\sigma)$ is in $\mathcal F$, meaning that some $E_\alpha\subseteq {\rm sym}^{\mathcal G}(\sigma)$, then $\sigma$ is <em>symmetric</em>. Let ${\rm HS^{\mathcal F}}$ be the collection of all hereditarily symmetric names. Let $G\subseteq \mathbb P$ be $L$-generic, and let $G_\beta$ be the restriction of $G$ to the initial segment $\Pi_{\alpha<\beta}{\rm Coll}(\omega,\omega_\alpha)$ of $\mathbb P$. Define

<p style="text-align:center">
$N=\{\sigma_G\mid\sigma\in {\rm HS}^{\mathcal F} \}.$
</p>
<p>Standard arguments show that $N\models{\rm ZF}$ and the subsets of ordinals of $N$ are precisely the subsets of ordinals added by the initial segments of the product $\mathbb P$, namely those in $V[G_\beta]$ for some $\beta<\omega_1$.  It follows that all $\omega_\alpha$ for $\alpha<\omega_1$ are countable in $N$, but $\omega_{\omega_1}$ is the $\omega_1$ of $N$. The desired model $\mathcal M=\langle M,\mathcal S\rangle$ of ${\rm Z}_2$ is obtained by taking $\mathcal S=P(\omega)^N=\bigcup_{\alpha<\omega_1}P(\omega)^{L[G_\alpha]}$.

It is easy to see that the choice scheme fails in $\mathcal M$. Let $r\in\mathcal S$ be a relation on $\omega$ coding $\omega_1^L$, and let $\alpha_n$ be the ordinal coded by $n$ in $r$. The model $\mathcal M$ satisfies that for every $n\in\omega$, the code of $L_{\omega_{\alpha_n}}$ exists, but there is no collecting set of the codes of all $L_{\omega_{\alpha_n}}$ because such a set must be uncountable in $N$.

Now we argue that the choice scheme must hold for any parameter-free assertion in $\mathcal M$. Suppose that $\mathcal M\models\forall n\,\exists X\,\varphi(n,X)$. We can assume, by working below some condition if necessary, that this statement is forced by $1_{\mathbb P}$ about the canonical $\mathbb P$-name $\dot {\mathcal M}$ for $\mathcal M$. We will argue in a moment that for every $n\in\omega$, there is $\xi_n<\omega_1$ such that it is forced by $1_{\mathbb P}$ that there is $A\in L[G_{\xi_n}]$ such that $\dot{\mathcal M}\models\varphi(n,A)$. Let's finish the argument, supposing this to be the case. Since $\omega_1$ is regular in $L$, there is an upper bound $\xi<\omega_1$ for the $\xi_n$, and so $1_{\mathbb P}$ forces that all witnessing $A$ are in $L[G_\xi]$. But $P(\omega)^{L[G_\xi]}$ is countable in $N$, so that the collection of the witnessing $A$ is coded by a subset of $\omega$ in $N$ and is therefore in $\mathcal S$. It remains to prove our assumption.

Fix $n$. Since there is some $A\in\mathcal S$ such that $\mathcal M\models\varphi(n,A)$ and $A$ must be in $L[G_\xi]$ for some $\xi$, it follows that there is a condition $p\in\mathbb P$ and some ordinal $\xi<\omega_1$ such that $p$ forces that there is $A\in L[G_\xi]$ such that $\dot{\mathcal M}\models\varphi(n,A)$. If this statement is not forced by $1_{\mathbb P}$, then there is some condition $q$ forcing that this is  not the case. Let $\pi$ be a coordinate respecting automorphism such that $\pi(p)$ and $q$ are compatible. But it is not difficult to see that $\pi(\dot {\mathcal M})$ and $\dot{\mathcal M}$ will be interpreted identically by any $L$-generic filter $G$ because $L[G_\alpha]=L[\pi(\dot G_\alpha)_G]$ for all $\alpha<\omega_1$ because $\pi(\dot G_\xi)_G$ is $H_\xi$ for $H=(\pi^{-1})'' G$.
Thus, $\pi(p)$ forces that there is $A\in L[G_\xi]$ such that $\dot{\mathcal M}\models\varphi(n,A)$, which contradicts our assumption that $q$ forced the negation of this statement. $\square$

Incidentally, the dependent choice scheme and the parameter-free dependent choice scheme are equivalent [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_46">1</a>]. The dependent choice scheme asserts for every second-order formula $\varphi(X,Y,W)$  that whenever $\forall X\,\exists Y\,\varphi(X,Y,A)$ holds, then we can make $\omega$-many dependent choices for the relation given by $\varphi$, meaning that there is a set $Z$ such that $\forall n\,\varphi(Z_n,Z_{n+1},A)$.</p>

<div>Norman Lewis Perlmutter, LaGuardia Community College</div>
<div>October 17, 2014</div>
<div></div>
<div>This talk concerns joint work with Robert S. Lubarsky.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>Elementary epimorphisms were introduced by Philipp Rothmaler. A surjective homomorphism f: M &#8211;&gt; N between two model-theoretic structures is an elementary epimorphism if and only if every formula with parameters satisfied by N is satisfied in M using a preimage of those parameters.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Philipp asked me whether nontrivial elementary epimorphisms between models of set theory exist. We answer this question in the negative for fully elementary epimorphisms between models of ZFC, but in the positive under weaker assumptions.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>In particular, we show that every Pi_1-elementary epimorphism between models of ZF is an isomorphism. On the other hand, nonisomorphic Sigma_1-elementary epimorphisms between models of ZF can be constructed, as can fully elementary epimorphisms between models of ZFC^-.</div>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my second year of undergrad I had a formative experience with Delta-Epsilon proofs that stuck with me for a long time. Last week I was able to provide a similar experience for some first year calculus students.</p>
<p><span id="more-1189"></span></p>
<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>At the beginning of class the students had handed in their assignments for the week and the instructor (Ross Stokke) began lecturing; it started with a proof of a limit using the Delta-Epsilon definition. Ross gives some explanation and motivation, and then the TA walks in, ready to collect the assignments for grading.</p>
<p>On the board, Ross begins the proof as always: Let $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Of course the next step is to provide a $\delta&gt;0$. (Normally you find this by doing a couple minutes of calculation on the back of your page. Students know how to do this, but it takes some time.)</p>
<p>Ross asks the class if they know what $\delta$ should be. We all shrug.</p>
<p>Ross then turns to the distracted TA who is collecting the assignments and asks him what the $\delta$ should be. He looks up at the limit and says &#8220;$\frac{\epsilon}{3}$&#8221; and goes back to collecting assignments. Ross confirmed this was a good choice and continued on with the proof.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/brainyflix/photos/1066/medium.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="340" /></p>
<p>We were all flabbergasted. How did he know?</p>
<h2>Now I know he isn&#8217;t actually a wizard&#8230;</h2>
<p>I was shocked, but I knew that the TA wasn&#8217;t some kind of super-genius. Rather than be dismayed by this impressive feat I was motivated to learn this skill for myself. Suddenly, mastering these types of problems wasn&#8217;t something that only super-smart brainiacs could do.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i2.wp.com/listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pythagoras_humanity-healing-1.jpg?resize=550%2C330" alt="" width="550" height="330" /></p>
<p>This was an important moment in my undergrad. It jarred me into the mindset that <em>I too could be the master of a skill</em>.</p>
<h2>History repeats itself</h2>
<p>Flashforward to this school year and one of the calculus instructors (Alfonso) is holding a massive office hour in the Huron lounge for about 25 students (I&#8217;m working on a research problem with my colleague Ivan, who is a calculus instructor this year). After about 90 minutes of Alfonso working through problems on the board, the students want to see a &#8220;piecewise limit&#8221;. So he invents this one:</p>
<p>$f(x)=$</p>
<ul>
<li>$2x &#8211; 3$ if $3 \leq x$</li>
<li>$6-x$ if $x &lt; 3$.</li>
</ul>
<p>He starts writing the proof (&#8220;Let $\epsilon&gt;0$&#8221;) and I interrupt him.</p>
<p>I ask if any of his students know what the $\delta$ should be. He asks and they shrug their shoulders.</p>
<p>So I yell over to Ivan (who has been helping a student, and hasn&#8217;t been listening at all) and ask him what the delta should be. He snaps out of his discussion, looks up, pauses and says &#8220;\frac{\epsilon}{2}.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/brainyflix/photos/1066/medium.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="340" /></p>
<p>Alfonso confirms that this will work, and goes on to write the details.</p>
<h2>Is this a good teaching strategy?</h2>
<p>On the surface this &#8220;magic&#8221; trick seems like one that should be used judiciously and infrequently. I want math to seem like something we can all do (given enough time, effort and struggle), and this trick seems to go against that principle. This trick could possibly serve to make students feel more unable to do math by pointing out how much better the instructors are at calculus than them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I like that as a student this trick feels like something you can&#8217;t do at the moment but could possibly do in the future. I feel like this is the correct use of this kind of trick; show them something cool, then give them the tools to get to that level.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>]]></summary>

<p>Since the seminal results of Levy and Solovay [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_62">1</a>] on the indestructibility of large cardinals by small forcing and Laver on the making a supercompact cardinal indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-directed closed forcing [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_63">2</a>], indestructibility properties of various large cardinal notions have been intensively studied. A decade after Laver&#8217;s result, Gitik and Shelah showed that strong cardinals can be made indestructible by all weakly $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing with the Prikry property [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_64">3</a>] (see this <a href="http://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/2009/10/28/making-strong-cardinals-indestructible-by-leqkappa-weakly-closed-prikry-forcing/" target="_blank">post</a>), a class that includes all $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing, and Woodin showed, using his technique of surgery, that they can be made indestructible by forcing of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)$. More recently, Hamkins and Johnstone showed that strongly unfoldable cardinals can be made indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\kappa^+$-preserving forcing [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_65">4</a>]. It turns out that not all large cardinals possess robust indestructibility properties. Very recently, Bagaria et al. showed that a number of large cardinal notions including superstrong, huge, and rank-into-rank cardinals are superdestructible: they cannot even be indestructible by ${\rm Add}(\kappa,1)$ [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_66">5</a>]. In this article, we show that remarkable cardinals have indestructibility properties resembling those of strong cardinals. They can be made indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\leq\kappa$-distributive forcing and by all two-step iterations of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)*\dot{\mathbb R}$, where $\dot{\mathbb R}$ is forced to be $\lt\kappa$-closed and $\leq\kappa$-distributive.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: If $\kappa$ is remarkable, then there is a forcing extension in which the remarkability of $\kappa$ is becomes indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\leq\kappa$-distributive forcing and by all two-step iterations ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)*\dot{\mathbb R}$, where $\dot{\mathbb R}$ is forced to be $\lt\kappa$-closed and $\leq\kappa$-distributive.</p>
<p>In particular, a remarkable $\kappa$ can be made indestructible by all $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing, and since $\dot {\mathbb R}$ can be trivial, by all forcing of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)$. One application of the main theorem is that any ${\rm GCH}$ pattern can be forced above a remarkable cardinal. Another application uses a recent forcing construction of Cheng, Hamkins, and Friedman [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_67">6</a>], to produce a remarkable cardinal that is not remarkable in ${\rm HOD}$. Using techniques from the proof the main theorem, we also show that remarkability is preserved by the canonical forcing of the ${\rm GCH}$.</p>
<p>For the indestructibility arguments, we define the notion of a <em>remarkable Laver function</em> and show that every remarkable cardinal carries such a function. Although Laver-like functions can be forced to exist for many large cardinal notions [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_68">7</a>], remarkable cardinals along with supercompact and strong cardinals are some of the few that outright possess such fully set-anticipating functions. For instance, not every strongly unfoldable cardinal has a Laver-like function because it is consistent that $\diamondsuit_\kappa({\rm REG})$ fails at a strongly unfoldable cardinal [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_69">8</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A cardinal $\kappa$ is <em>remarkable</em> if in the ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$ forcing extension $V[G]$, for every regular cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$, there is a $V$-regular cardinal $\overline\lambda<\kappa$ and $j:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_\lambda^V$ with critical point $\gamma$ such that $j(\gamma)=\kappa$.

Schindler originally used a different primary characterization of remarkable cardinals, but he has recently switched to using the above characterization, which gives remarkable cardinals a character of generic supercompactness [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_70">9</a>]. Magidor showed that $\kappa$ is supercompact if and only if for every regular cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$, there is a regular cardinal $\overline \lambda<\kappa$ and  $j:H_{\overline\lambda}\to H_\lambda$ with critical point $\gamma$ such $j(\gamma)=\kappa$ [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_71">10</a>].</p>
<p>Schindler introduced remarkable cardinals when he isolated them as the large cardinal notion whose existence is equiconsistent with the assertion that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ cannot be altered by proper forcing. The assertion that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ is absolute for all set forcing is intimately connected with ${\rm AD}^{L(\mathbb R)}$ and its consistency strength lies in the neighborhood of infinitely many Woodin cardinals [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_72">11</a>]. In contrast, remarkable cardinals are much weaker than measurable cardinals, and indeed they can exist in $L$. Consistency-wise, they fit tightly into the $\alpha$-iterable hierarchy of large cardinal notions (below a Ramsey cardinal) introduced by Gitman and Welch [<a class="papercite_bibcite" href="#paperkey_73">12</a>], where they lie above 1-iterable, but below 2-iterable cardinals, placing them above hierarchies of ineffability, but much below an $\omega$-ErdÅs cardinal. Remarkable cardinals are also totally indescribable and $\Sigma_2$-reflecting. Strong cardinals are remarkable, but the least measurable cardinal cannot be remarkable  by $\Sigma_2$-reflection.

<p>We will introduce two fun projects involving Geodesy, which is devoted to measuring things to do with the Earth.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Without doing anything dangerous, measure the height of your school&#8221;</h2>
<p>I love this question. It is a bit affronting (how could I possibly do that?!), but there&#8217;s something magical about it that draws you in and gets you using your imagination. If you have never thought about this question before, please take the time now. (Seriously, go for a walk and think about it.)</p>
<p>I have posed this question to many people and have received many different solutions. When I talk to people about this problem I am struck by what solution they think is the most &#8220;obvious&#8221; or &#8220;natural&#8221; solution. Think about that as we examine this problem.</p>
<p><span id="more-1178"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get straight into some solutions that I&#8217;ve heard.</p>
<h2>The &#8220;Math&#8221; solution</h2>
<p>The idea here is to go out on a sunny day and measure the length of the shadow that an upright metre stick casts on the ground. That tells you two sides of a right triangle (the one formed by the metre stick and its shadow). Now you can measure the length of the shadow of your school. The triangle formed by the school and its shadow is in the same ratio as the triangle formed by the metre stick and its shadow (they are similar triangles). Using the fact that their ratios are the same you can solve for the height of the school.</p>
<p>This is essentially illustrated here.</p>
<div style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://mathforum.org/sanders/connectinggeometry/ch_09Similar.html"><img src="http://mathforum.org/sanders/connectinggeometry/8shadow.gif" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Credit to Cathleen Sanders for the useful picture. Visit her site for more information on this project.</p></div>
<p>This seems like a fairly nice solution. It is easy to execute, scales nicely to larger structures and the underlying math is fairly elementary. However, <em>I don&#8217;t think this is the first solution we should be teaching students</em>. I think the solution is nice and beautiful and satisfying, but it is too alien for a first solution. Let me explain.</p>
<h3>This solution introduces many surprising extra elements</h3>
<p>Why are we using shadows? Why are we using similar triangles? What part of the question suggests that this is one of the ways to approach it?</p>
<p>Students should not have too much trouble <em>understanding</em> this solution, but remembering this solution is a whole different story (&#8220;It was something about shadows I think&#8230;&#8221;). This solution is clever, but seems to just appear out of nowhere. Part of the beauty of this question is there are dozens of possible solutions, and I feel like this one stifles problem solving because students begin to focus on geometry, rather than the task at hand.</p>
<p>That being said, my wife argued (fairly persuasively) that this is aÂ  natural solution for anyone who has seen geometry recently. So perhaps my complaint is less valid.</p>
<h2>A method for getting new solutions</h2>
<p>I could, if I wanted, just list out possible solutions to this. Perhaps I could dazzle you with the variety and creativity of my solutions. That isn&#8217;t the goal though. I&#8217;m going to show you a handy method for problem solving that <em>naturally</em> leads to many possible solutions.</p>
<h3>Identify the key difficulties</h3>
<p>Try to identify what part of the problem is giving you trouble. You can state it precisely, or abstract a little bit. Here are some possible difficulties you might encounter in this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;The wall is too big.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get to the top of the wall.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Large vertical distances are hard to measure.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ask related questions</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s try to break down these difficulties with related questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the tallness of the school really the problem? Are there other big things that you know how to measure? For example the school yard is much bigger than your school and you can probably measure the yard. What is the real difficulty?</li>
<li>Do <em>you</em> need to get to the top of the wall, or do you just need <em>something</em> to get to the top of the wall? Can you send something else in your place?</li>
<li>What sort of distances are easier to measure?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Answer these related questions</h3>
<p>For questions 1 and 3 we can see that large <em>horizontal</em> distances are fairly easy to measure.</p>
<div style="width: 322px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.assessmentservices-edu.com/images/products/detail/TrundlePhotoshop.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="389" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The &#8220;spinny-clicky thing&#8221; also known as a Trundle Wheel</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So our problem isn&#8217;t measuring large distances, it is measuring large <em>vertical</em> distances.</p>
<p>So&#8230; how can we get around this? Well let&#8217;s try the most naive thing we can &#8220;turn vertical distances into horizontal distances.&#8221; This sounds tricky, but let&#8217;s see what sort of things we can come up with. By the way, turning something hard into something easy is one of the key problem solving techniques. Frame what you don&#8217;t know in terms of things you do know.</p>
<h3>Some (possibly dangerous) ways to turn vertical into horizontal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Knock down the wall. (Well, this could work, but there are all sorts of logistical problems with it. What would happen if we actually did it though? Really we would be doing the next thing&#8230;)</li>
<li>Count the number of bricks in the wall, then lay a couple bricks on the ground and measure them.</li>
<li>(Can you think of any others?)</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s neat! We realized that a dangerous solution can actually lead to a simple, non-dangerous solution!</p>
<h3>Back to question 2 &#8211; Do <em>you</em> need to get to the top of the wall?</h3>
<p>What are some ways that we know to get things on to the top of the school? Or, more generally, how can we overcome large vertical distances?</p>
<p>Here are a couple of the ways that I&#8217;ve heard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rockets or Catapults. (Not so crazy of an idea!)</li>
<li>Fire Trucks.</li>
<li>Stairs.</li>
<li>Strong Muscles, or throwing something.</li>
<li>Slingshots.</li>
<li>Tall animals (Giraffes?)</li>
<li>Birds.</li>
<li>Animals that climb walls. (Ants, squirrels, &#8230;)</li>
<li>Trees.</li>
<li>Smoke or Hot Air.</li>
<li>Helium Balloons.</li>
<li>Laser Pointers. (In general: light.)</li>
<li>Sound. (Echos)</li>
<li>Rain or Snow. (These overcome vertical distances in the other direction, from the sky to the ground.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The neat thing is that most of these tools will give solutions to our problem.</p>
<h3>Use these tools to solve the problem</h3>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s take helium balloons. It seems fairly natural that we could tie a long string to a helium balloon, let the balloon float to the top of the school, then measure the length of string needed.</p>
<p>Or let&#8217;s take strong muscles. We can throw a ball attached to some string on to the school, mark off the string used, then pull down the ball and measure the string used.</p>
<p>These solutions seem genius and creative, but really they are logical and come about naturally from examining the problem. This is useful when (like most mathematicians) you aren&#8217;t particularly clever, but are good at asking questions.</p>
<h2>Inside the Box thinking and Outside the Box thinking</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take this opportunity to talk about &#8220;inside the box thinking&#8221;. It often gets a bad rap and is used to indicate complacency, submission and boringness. Outside the Box thinkers are usually those among us who are thought to be exciting, original, creative and getting promotions. I want to dispel this a little bit.</p>
<p>An inside the box thinker will ask the following questions when faced with a problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem?</li>
<li>What is the key difficulty?</li>
<li>Do I know ways to solve related problems?</li>
<li>What are the known tools for overcoming the key difficulties?</li>
<li>What are the rules? How do the rules interact with each other? How do I exploit them? (These are particularly true of such a thinker playing board games.)</li>
</ul>
<p>What does an outside the box thinker try to do to solve a problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Be creative.</li>
<li>Be clever.</li>
<li>Be original.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those things are well and good, but I don&#8217;t really know how to teach these things in a concrete way. I would also wager that most people (like me) aren&#8217;t particularly clever or creative or original, but that&#8217;s okay! I think that inside the box thinking will get you pretty far!</p>
<h3>Example: Poker</h3>
<p>In general mathematicians can make very good poker players. They have a good sense of probability, expected value, what hands are good, how often to keep hands, etc.. They have a strong understanding of the rules of the game and how probability interacts with them. As a result, among amateurs, mathematicians can become near the best players. You will do very well at your local poker night if you just stick to &#8220;playing the odds&#8221;. This is the inside the box approach to poker.</p>
<p>Will you become one of the top pros doing just this? No, probably not. To do this you need to be thinking more like Tom McEvoy&#8217;s famous quote: &#8220;Poker is not a card game with people, it is a people game with cards.&#8221; This is more like outside the box thinking. You need to see the game not merely as a card game, but a people game.</p>
<p>You can examine this in more detail with this article &#8220;<a href="http://www.pocketfives.com/articles/why-intelligent-people-sometimes-struggle-poker-486388/">Why Intelligent People Sometimes Struggle with Poker</a>&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Summary of the problem</h2>
<p>Before we move on, let&#8217;s summarize our work on this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>We identified the key difficulties. (Overcoming vertical distances.)</li>
<li>We asked related questions. (What things can overcome these?)</li>
<li>We answered these questions. (Light, Fire Trucks, Trees, Helium Balloons)</li>
<li>We adapt (some of) these tools to solve our original question. (Let the Helium Balloon float to the top of the school, measure the string used.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teaching this project</h2>
<p>When teaching this project you are likely to find students who get overwhelmed by the question. The massiveness of the problem is part of its appeal, but some for some students this is very off-putting.</p>
<p>To try to counteract this help them break up the problem into more manageable bites. Use the approach we&#8217;ve described to allow the student to engage in questions on a smaller scale. Encourage the student to be analytic, rather than creative if they find themselves being overwhelmed; being clever is hard, identifying what is giving you difficulty is liberating.</p>
<p>Some students will also latch on to different aspects of the problem. Some will like the brainstorming (the strategists), some will like the building/execution (the engineers), some will like the teamwork.</p>
<h2>Going Further</h2>
<p>What to do with students who need a bigger challenge? One of the most straightforward things is to ask for measurements of bigger things! In Toronto, the natural thing is the CN Tower. How&#8217;s that for cool? What student will forget about trigonometry once they&#8217;ve used it to measure the height of the CN Tower?</p>
<p>A word of warning though, you need to exercise judgement when giving this problem. For a student who barely struggled through the school measuring problem it can be quite disparaging to get this problem and find that most of your old tools don&#8217;t work. This problem is less forgiving than the previous one.</p>
<p>That being said, all of a sudden things that were easy become hard. For example, is it easy to find the end of the CN Tower&#8217;s shadow? This on its own could be tricky!</p>
<h2>Other problems in Geodesy</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s mention some other problems that go further than this, but are still within the grasp of (motivated) students.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the circumference of the Earth?</li>
<li>How far away is the moon/sun?</li>
<li>How big are they?</li>
<li>How far away is your favourite star?</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems should all be solvable in theory with the ideas available to students. In some cases the limiting factor is the accuracy of the physical tools available.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s focus on one of these problems&#8230;</p>
<h2>What is the circumference of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s focus on three nice historical solutions to this problem (although there are other solutions I&#8217;ve omitted). Most of this was gleaned from the Wikipedia article &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_geodesy">History of Geodesy</a>&#8221;, which is a fascinating read!</p>
<h3>~250 BCE &#8211; Eratosthenes&#8217; Shadows</h3>
<p>This is probably the most famous method. It basically amounts to measuring the shadow of a metre stick in two places at the same time, when you know that one of sticks has no shadow at that particular time. In that case, knowing the angle created by the shadow in the place where there was a shadow (in Eratosthenes&#8217; case it was one fiftieth of a circle) and knowing the distance between the two measurement sites (in this case 5000 stadia), is enough to tell you the circumference of the earth (in this case 50 times 5000 stadia).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the picture:</p>
<div style="width: 441px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eratosthenes%27_method_for_determining_the_size_of_the_Earth.svg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Eratosthenes%27_method_for_determining_the_size_of_the_Earth.svg/431px-Eratosthenes%27_method_for_determining_the_size_of_the_Earth.svg.png" alt="" width="431" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Taken from Wikimedia Commons.</p></div>
<h3>~830 CE &#8211; Travelling to Mecca</h3>
<p>This next one is really neat because it is so culturally motivated. Suppose for the moment that you are a Muslim in the 9th century. It is important to you that you know which direction Mecca is in (so you know in which direction to pray) and it is important to you that you know how far away Mecca is from your home (so that when you make your pilgrimage you know how many supplies to bring, how long it will take, etc.). It turns out that these measurements, together with the development of spherical geometry, led to an estimate for the circumference of the Earth.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_geodesy#Islamic_world">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Around AD 830 Caliph al-Ma&#8217;mun commissioned a group of astronomers to measure the distance from Tadmur (Palmyra) to al-Raqqah, in modern Syria. They found the cities to be separated by one degree of latitude and the distance between them to be 66<span class="frac nowrap"><sup>2</sup>â<sub>3</sub></span>Â miles and thus calculated the Earth&#8217;s circumference to be 24,000Â miles. Another estimate given was 56<span class="frac nowrap"><sup>2</sup>â<sub>3</sub></span> Arabic miles per degree, which corresponds to 111.8Â km per degree and a circumference of 40,248Â km, very close to the currently modern values of 111.3Â km per degree and 40,068Â km circumference, respectively.</p></blockquote>
<h3>990 CE &#8211; The 17 year old</h3>
<p>You should read about the exploits of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_geodesy#Biruni">Abu Rayhan Biruni here</a>. At 17 years old he came up with a new method for estimating the circumference of the Earth that avoided &#8220;walking across hot, dusty deserts&#8221;. The method is nice and is within the grasp of a high school student.</p>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this foray into Geodesy. I certainly enjoyed learning the interesting history of Geodesy (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_Triangulation_of_Great_Britain">Principal Triangulation of Britain</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retriangulation_of_Great_Britain">Retriangulation of Great Britain</a>.)</p>
<p>Please let me know if you try any of these experiments on your own; I would love to hear about them or see pictures! You can <a title="Contact Me" href="http://boolesrings.org/mpawliuk/contact-me/">get in touch with me here</a>.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My new job at LaGuardia has been exciting and a lot of work. There&#8217;s a lot of new information to take in and procedures to figure out, but I&#8217;m adapting to it all. LaGuardia hired 70 new instructional faculty this year, 12 of them in the math department (including computer science and engineering). The school is growing by leaps and bounds. It&#8217;s great to be part of this large group of incomingÂ faculty; it feels like we&#8217;re undertaking a grand adventure together, and we areÂ availableÂ to support each otherÂ throughÂ the challenges of the experience. Like the student body, the faculty exhibit great diversity in ethnicity and in life experience. Even by CUNY standards, LaGuardia is a very diverse place, and that&#8217;s really saying something.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a few opportunities to hear President Mellow address the new hires, and she is a very charismatic leader. She really seems to have a strong vision for the direction of the school, and she makes us feel that our work is very important.</p>
<p>The facilities of the school are much better than I was expecting. From the outside it looks like a series of ugly brown bulidings . . . but it&#8217;s the inside that matters, as that&#8217;s where I spend more time. The bathrooms are reasonably clean, and the elevators operate reasonably quickly. I have a good-sized private office, painted in interesting colors, with almost-new furniture including plenty of bookshelves, a filing cabinet, another cabinet, and pegs to hang my coat, backpack, etc. No windows to the outside, though some small high windows let in light from the hallway. Offices with outside windows are assigned based on seniority. Â I have a much larger desk than I had at FAU. Â The hallways are decorated with an eclectic collection ofÂ artwork, much of it by LaGuardia students, and painted in bright colors. There is a beautiful courtyard with greenery and benches, and a hall of flags with a high ceiling from which hang flags from many nations of the world. Is it all the nations of the world or just the ones that LaGuardia students come from? I don&#8217;t think there would be a big difference actually.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prior to this summer&#39;s <a href="http://www.maa.org/meetings/mathfest">MathFest</a> in Portland, I was a co-facilitator for a four-day <a href="http://iblworkshop.org/home.html">workshop on inquiry-based learning</a>. My co-facilitators were <a href="http://www.stanyoshinobu.com">Stan Yoshinobu</a> (Cal Poly, SLO), <a href="http://www.csudh.edu/math/mjones/">Matt Jones</a> (CSU Dominguez Hills), and <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/math/people/hodge/">Angie Hodge</a> (University of Nebraska at Omaha). I love being a part of these workshops. Even though I&#39;m there to help others get started on implementing IBL, I benefit tremendously from the experience and always leave feeling energized and fired up to teach. If you are an aspiring practitioner or a newish user of IBL, I highly encourage you to look into attending a future <a href="http://iblworkshop.org/home.html">IBL Workshop</a>, which is run as an <a href="http://www.maa.org/programs/faculty-and-departments/prep-workshops">MAA PREP workshop</a>.</p>

<p>On day three of the workshop, I gave a 30-minute plenary talk. Most of the sessions are designed to be highly interactive and this was one of the few times that we &quot;talked at&quot; the participants. At the end of day two, I had given the participants a choice of topics for the plenary and the request was to describe the general overview of my approach to IBL in proof-based classes versus a class like calculus. So, that&#39;s what I set out to do. The slides I used for my talk can be found below.</p>

</div>

<p>I&#39;d like to think that my talk was more than the content of the slides, however, the slides ought be useful on their own for someone that is curious <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">about IBL</a>. This talk was similar to others about IBL that <a href="http://danaernst.com/?s=inquiry-based+learning+talk">I&#39;ve given in the past</a>.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/07/GGraphD4k+2.png" align="left" width="200" img style="margin-right: 15px"/>My colleague <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/%7Ens46/">Nandor Sieben</a> and I recently submitted for publication a paper titled &quot;Impartial achievement and avoidance games for generating finite groups.&quot;  The current arXiv version of the article is located <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0784">here</a>.  My typical pure mathematics research interests are in the combinatorics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group">Coxeter groups</a> and their associated algebras, so while I have a background in group theory and combinatorics, this was my first research experience in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory">combinatorial game theory</a>. In fact, prior to working on this project, I knew next to nothing about the subject. In the year and a half we worked on the project, I learned a tremendous amount of new material, which was a lot of fun. It was exciting to branch out and try something new.</p>

<p>Here is the abstract for the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We study two impartial games introduced by Anderson and Harary and further developed by Barnes. Both games are played by two players who alternately select previously unselected elements of a finite group. The first player who builds a generating set from the jointly selected elements wins the first game. The first player who cannot select an element without building a generating set loses the second game. After the development of some general results, we determine the nim-numbers of these games for abelian and dihedral groups. We also present some conjectures based on computer calculations. Our main computational and theoretical tool is the structure diagram of a game, which is a type of identification digraph of the game digraph that is compatible with the nim-numbers of the positions. Structure diagrams also provide simple yet intuitive visualizations of these games that capture the complexity of the positions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fundamental problem in the theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_game">impartial combinatorial games</a> is the determination of the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Nim-Value.html">nim-number</a> of the game. This allows for the calculation of the nim-numbers of game sums and the determination of the outcome of the games. The major aim of this paper is the development of some theoretical tools that allow the calculation of the nim-numbers of the achievement and avoidance games for a variety of familiar groups.  In the paper, we introduce the structure diagram of a game, which is an identification digraph of the game digraph that is compatible with the nim-numbers of the positions. Structure diagrams also provide simple but intuitive visualizations of these games that capture the complexity of the positions. By making further identifications, we obtain the simplified structure diagram of a game, which is our main computational and theoretical tool in the paper.</p>

<p>We developed a software package that computes the simplified structure digraph of the achievement and avoidance games. We used <a href="http://www.gap-system.org">GAP</a> to get the maximal subgroups and the rest of the computation is implemented in C++. The software is efficient enough to allow us to compute the nim-numbers for the smallest 100,000 groups, which includes all groups up to size 511. The result is available on our <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/ns46/GroupGenGame/">companion web page</a>.</p>

<p>In April of 2013, I gave two talks at the University of Nebraska at Omaha that introduce the two games that this paper is about, but did not elaborate on the nim-number aspect.  I summarized those talks in <a href="http://danaernst.com/talk-impartial-games-for-generating-groups/">this blog post</a>.</p>]]></summary>

Then, it is proved that for every regular cardinal $\kappa&gt;\aleph_1$, the principle $\square(\kappa)$ is equivalent to the existence of a certain strong coloring $c:[\kappa]^2\rightarrow\kappa$ for which the family of fibers $\mathcal T(c)$ is a nonspecial $\kappa$-Aronszajn tree.</p>
<p>The theorem follows from an analysis ofÂ  a new characteristic function for walks on ordinals, and implies in particular that ifÂ  the $\kappa$-chain condition is productive for a given regular cardinal $\kappa&gt;\aleph_1$, then $\kappa$ is weakly compact in some inner model of ZFC. This provides a partial converse to the fact that if $\kappa$ is a weakly compact cardinal, then the $\kappa$-chain condition is productive.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On May 22, I accepted a tenure-track professor position at <a href="http://www.laguardia.cuny.edu/About/Fast-Facts/">LaGuardia Community College</a>. LaGuardia is part of the City University of New York (CUNY) the same university system where I went to graduate school. It is located in Long Island City with in the borough of Queens, in the far southwest corner of Queens, south of Astoria and west of Sunnyside. The college is exceptional among community colleges in that the majority of faculty have PhDs and faculty are expected to do some research.</p>
<p>Several people have asked me whether LaGuardia Community College is located near LaGuardia airport. They are about five miles apart. They share the same name because they&#8217;re both named after a former mayor of New York, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiorello_H._La_Guardia">Fiorello LaGuardia</a>. LaGuardia was mayor during the 1930s. Although he was a Republican, he was also a progressive and an ally of FDR. He spoke several languages and stood up for immigrants. Therefore, it is particularly appropriate that LaGuardia Community College is named for him, as the college has an extremely ethnically diverse student body even by CUNY standards, which is really saying something. This is meaningful to me personally because my great-grandparents were immigrants, and I like the idea of helping immigrants and first-generation college students to improve their lives.</p>
<p>I am very happy to be moving back to New York City, as I really love the culture and lifestyle there. Â It will also be nice to socialize and work with my many friends and colleagues in set theory at CUNY. CUNY has one of the most active set theory research groups in the world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also nice to have the security of a tenure-track position. Moving around every few years for postdocs would be exhausting, I think.The move down to Florida really took a toll on me, although in retrospect it was fun to live for a year in Florida, and I learned a lot about myself and my personal and professional life goals through the experience. There are a few people, places, and lifestyle aspects that I&#8217;ll really miss from Florida, but overall, I think I&#8217;ll be much happier back in New York. I&#8217;m planning to move around the end of July.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>We show that, in terms of both implication and consistency strength, an extendible with a larger strong cardinal is stronger than an enhanced supercompact, which is itself stronger than a hypercompact, which is itself weaker than an extendible. All of these are easily seen to be stronger than a supercompact. We also study $C^{(n)}$ -supercompactness.</p>]]></summary>

We&#39;ve had a fantastic turn out in terms of speakers and attendees both years.  This year we thought we would try something new and decided to organize a poster session instead.  Here&#39;s the abstract for the session:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New and experienced instructors implementing inquiry-based learning methods are invited to share their experiences, resources, and insights in this poster session. The posters in this session will focus on IBL best practices. We seek both novel ideas and effective approaches to IBL. Claims made should be supported by data (student responses, sample work, test scores, survey results, etc.). This session will be of interest to instructors new to IBL, as well as experienced practitioners looking for new ideas. Presenters should have their materials prepared in advance and will be provided with a self-standing, trifold tabletop poster approximately 48 in wide by 36 in high.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of our goals of the poster session is to increase interaction between presenters and attendees.  We hope that someone can wander around and gather a lot of information about implementing IBL in a short period of time. I&#39;m not usually a fan of poster sessions, but I&#39;m looking forward to this one.  The poster session takes place on Thursday, August 7 at 3:30-5:00PM in the Hilton Portland, Plaza Level, Plaza Foyer.  If you are attending MathFest, please stop by the poster session.  Also, if you think you have something interesting to share, we encourage you to <a href="http://www.maa.org/mathfest/abstracts">submit an abstract</a>. The deadline for submission is Friday, June 13, 2014.</p>

<p>Questions regarding this session should be sent to the organizers:</p>

<p>Angie Hodge, University of Nebraska at Omaha
Dana Ernst, Northern Arizona University
Stan Yoshinobu, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</p>

Here is a trial.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A square principle for a cardinal $\theta$ asserts the existence of a sequence $\Gamma=\langle C_\alpha \mid \alpha&lt;\theta\rangle$ such that for all $\alpha&lt;\theta$, $C_\alpha$ is a closed subset of $\theta$.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characteristics</span></p>
<ol>
<li>$S(\Gamma)$, the <em>support</em> of $\Gamma$, is the set $\{\alpha&lt;\theta\mid C_\alpha\subseteq\sup(C_\alpha)=\alpha\}$;</li>
<li>$w(\Gamma)$, the <em>width</em> of $\Gamma$, is the cardinal $\sup\{ |\mathcal T(\Gamma,\alpha)|\mid \alpha&lt;\theta\}$, where $$\mathcal T(\Gamma,\alpha)=\{ C_\beta\cap\alpha\mid \beta&lt;\theta,\sup(C_\beta\cap\alpha)=\alpha\};$$</li>
<li>Nontriviality condition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0309729">(Jensen, 1972)</a>. In $L$, if $\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal, then $\square_\kappa$ holds. That is, there exists a sequenceÂ $\Gamma=\langle C_\alpha\mid \alpha&lt;\kappa^+\rangle$ with</p>
<ol>
<li>$S(\Gamma)=\{\alpha&lt;\kappa^+\mid \alpha\text{ limit}\}$;</li>
<li>$w(\Gamma)=1$;</li>
<li>$\text{otp}(C_\alpha)\le\kappa$ for all $\alpha&lt;\kappa^+$.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0309729">(Jensen, 1972)</a>. In $L$, if $\kappa$ is an uncountable regular cardinal, then there exists a sequenceÂ $\Gamma=\langle C_\alpha\mid \alpha&lt;\kappa\rangle$ with</p>
<ol>
<li>$S(\Gamma)=\{\alpha&lt;\kappa\mid \alpha\text{ limit}\}$;</li>
<li>$w(\Gamma)=1$;</li>
<li>there exists a stationary subset $E\subset\kappa$ such that $E$ contains no accumulation points of $C_\alpha$ for all $\alpha&lt;\kappa$.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0763902">(Todorcevic, 1984)</a>. PFA refutes the existence of a sequence $\Gamma=\langle C_\alpha\mid \alpha&lt;\theta\rangle$ with</p>
<ol>
<li>$S(\Gamma)=\{\alpha&lt;\theta\mid \text{cf}(\alpha)=\omega_1\}$, $\theta=\text{cf}(\theta)&gt;\omega_1$;</li>
<li>$w(\Gamma)=1$;</li>
<li>there exists no club $C$ in $\theta$ such that $C\cap\alpha=C_\alpha$ for every $\alpha\in S(\Gamma)$ which is an accumulation point of $C$.</li>
</ol>
<p>(<a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0830071">Velickovic, 1986</a>, <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0908147">Todorcevic, 1987</a>, <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0964870">Shelah-Stanley, 1988</a>). If $\theta=\text{cf}(\theta)&gt;\omega_1$ is not weakly compact in L, then $\square(\theta)$ holds. That is, there exists a sequence $\Gamma=\langle C_\alphaÂ  \mid \alpha&lt;\theta\rangle$ with</p>
<ol>
<li>$S(\Gamma)=\{\alpha&lt;\theta\mid \alpha\text{ limit}\}$;</li>
<li>$w(\Gamma)=1$;</li>
<li>there exists no club $C$ in $\theta$ such that $C\cap\alpha=C_\alpha$ for every $\alpha\in S(\Gamma)$ which is an accumulation point of $C$.</li>

Foreman and Magidor wrote an <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1450520">interesting paper</a> on a couple of weak forms of square, but these principles fit more into the so-called <a href="http://blog.assafrinot.com/?tag=approachability-ideal">approachability</a> principles. What is the difference between square principles and approachability principles? the major ones are that the sets $C_\alpha$ do not have to be closed, and that instead of measuring the <em>width</em> of $\Gamma$, one seeks to occur into (some or all) bounded subsets of $C_\alpha$ sometime before arriving to $\alpha$.<br />
An important paper on approachability principles is the one by <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1360144">Dzamonja and Shelah</a>. Finally, it may worth metnioning that in Section 4 of <a href="http://blog.assafrinot.com/?p=244">this paper</a>, I am constructing a model where (weak) square fails at $\aleph_\omega$, yet a (quite useful) approachability principle holds.</p>

<p>We show that every $\Pi_1$-elementary epimorphism between models of $ZF$ is an isomorphism.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m currently teaching a unit on probability. One of the homework problems that I wrote was roughly follows. Consider the experiment of drawing four cards without replacement from a thoroughly shuffled deck of cards. What is the probability that the first card is a heart, the second is a diamond, the third is a heart, and the fourth is a spade?</p>
<p>A student, Michael, came into my office for help on the homework problems. While he was asking about various problems, I was shuffling a deck of cards. When we got to the problem given above, I first asked him for his intuition about the problem &#8211;was the probability likely or unlikely. He recognized that it was extremely unlikely. Then I used the deck of cards to illustrate the problem. So, I draw a card from the deck. I asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s the probability that it&#8217;s a heart?&#8221; &#8220;13/52&#8221; he answered. I drew a card from the top of the deck. It was a heart. &#8220;How about that, it was actually a heart,&#8221; I said. &#8220;What&#8217;s the probability that the next card is a diamond?&#8221; &#8220;13/51&#8221;. I drew the next card. It was a diamond. Wow. &#8220;Okay, what&#8217;s the probability that the next card is a heart?&#8221; &#8220;12/50&#8221;. I drew the next card. It was a heart! At this point we were pretty surprised. Michael made some comment about he really hoped the next card wouldn&#8217;t be a spade. I drew the next card . . . it was a spade! Weird.</p>
<p>The probability of this happening . . . about 0.4%.</p>
<p>Of course, this far from the first time that I had illustrated an experiment like this, so it&#8217;s not so surprising that eventually a coincidence would occur eventually. But still, it was pretty exciting.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>(This talk was given on March 31, 2014, at the University of Toronto to a class of mostly MAT 137 students. It was standing room only!)</p></blockquote>
<p>In my first year of undergrad I was bad at proofs. In my second year of undergrad I was terrible at proofs. In my third year I was okay at proofs, but I was terrible at studying proofs.</p>
<p>The way I used to learn proofs was by memorizing the words in the textbook&#8217;s proof, word by word, with almost no understanding. I knew math, and I was fairly good at problems, but I just couldn&#8217;t get any purchase when it came to learning proofs.</p>
<p>Eventually I started to pick up various &#8220;tricks&#8221; and strategies for learning proofs. This talk is aimed at me in first year, and what I needed to hear so that I could have studied proofs better. (&#8220;<em>I no proof good</em>.&#8221;)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll look at the basics of proof reading, the idea of definition unwinding and clever ideas, and finally we&#8217;ll present a general method for reading proofs.</p>
<p><span id="more-1110"></span></p>
<h2>Gloops and Snicks</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s prove the following theorem:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Theorem</strong>: A Gloop added to a Snick is a Snick.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Well we have no idea how to proceed because we don&#8217;t know what these things are! Before you start a proof you need to make sure that you understand the precise definitions of all of the words being used. How can you expect to manipulate things if you don&#8217;t know what they are?</p>
<p>So here are the definitions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Definition</strong>. A Gloop is something of the form $\vert_a^0$ where $a$ is an integer and a Snick is something of the form $\vert_b^1$ where $b$ is an integer.</p>
<p>Okay, now back to the proof. Let $x = \vert_a^0$ be a gloop and let $\vert_b^1$ be a snick (where $a,b$ are integers). Now $x + y = \vert_a^0 + \vert_b^1$ and we don&#8217;t know how to continue, because we don&#8217;t know how to add these things. So we need to understand that first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Definition</strong>. An integer of the form $2a + i$ (where $i$ is 0 or 1) can be written as $\vert_a^i$.</p>
<p>Now $x + y = \vert_a^0 + \vert_b^1 = (2a + 0) + (2b + 1) = 2(a + b) + 1 = \vert_{a+b}^1$, which is a Snick.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<strong>END OF PROOF</strong>]</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all seen this before. This is just the proof that an even number added to an odd number is an odd number.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to understand the words before you go through proofs. Look up the relevant definitions!</li>
<li>This proof required no insight or clever ideas; it is called &#8220;a proof by unwinding defintions&#8221;.</li>
<li>You need to justify each step. (In principle) proofs should be air-tight.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t make any assumptions about how you can manipulate objects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definition Unwinding and the Clever Idea</h2>
<p>Our goal when looking at proofs is partly to identify which parts of the proof are definition unwinding, and which parts actually required a new idea. In your first couple of years in math most proofs will require only one or zero clever ideas. Let&#8217;s try to identify the clever idea (if there is one) in the proof of the (modified) Squeeze theorem for functions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Theorem</strong>. Suppose $l(x), u(x)$ are differentiable functions (&#8216;l&#8217; is for lower, and &#8216;u&#8217; is for upper) and $f(x)$ is any function such that $l(x) &lt; f(x) &lt; u(x)$ for all $x \neq a$, and suppose $$\lim_{x \rightarrow a} l(x) = L = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} u(x)$$</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">THEN $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Let&#8217;s go through this proof as brainlessly as possible, trying only to unwind definitions and make obvious algebraic manipulations.</p>
<p>We want to prove that $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$, so we start by fixing an $\epsilon &gt; 0$, and we start looking for a $\delta &gt;0$ such that $$0 &lt; \vert x-a \vert &lt; \delta \Rightarrow \vert f(x) &#8211; L \vert &lt; \epsilon.$$</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s find that $\delta$! The only places we know to look are at $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} l(x) = L = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} u(x)$, so let&#8217;s say what those mean:</p>
<p>There is a $\delta_1 &gt;0$ such that $$0 &lt; \vert x-a \vert &lt; \delta_1 \Rightarrow \vert l(x) &#8211; L \vert &lt; \epsilon.$$ In this case we could also conclude that $$- \epsilon &lt; l(x) &#8211; L &lt; \epsilon$$ and so $$L &#8211; \epsilon &lt; l(x) &lt; L + \epsilon$$ (Nice! By being totally brainless we have found an upper and a lower bound for $l(x)$.)</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the other limit we know: $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} u(x) = L$. This says:</p>
<p>There is a $\delta_2 &gt;0$ such that $$0 &lt; \vert x-a \vert &lt; \delta_2 \Rightarrow \vert u(x) &#8211; L \vert &lt; \epsilon.$$ In this case we could also conclude that $$- \epsilon &lt; u(x) &#8211; L &lt; \epsilon$$ and so $$L &#8211; \epsilon &lt; u(x) &lt; L + \epsilon$$</p>
<p>Now it looks like we&#8217;ve done all the unwinding we can. Although now we have things that we can combine. Let&#8217;s try to combine some of our inequalities to get that what we want.</p>
<p>For $x \neq a$ we have $l(x) &lt; f(x) &lt; u(x)$, and for $0 &lt; \vert x-a \vert &lt; \delta_1$ we get $L-\epsilon &lt; l(x) &lt; f(x) &lt; u(x)$.</p>
<p>For $x \neq a$ we have $l(x) &lt; f(x) &lt; u(x)$, and for $0 &lt; \vert x-a \vert &lt; \delta_2$ we get $l(x) &lt; f(x) &lt; u(x) &lt; L+ \epsilon$.</p>
<p>If we had all three of these assumptions ($x \neq a$, $0 &lt; \vert x-a \vert &lt; \delta_1$ and $0 &lt; \vert x-a \vert &lt; \delta_2$) we would have $$L- \epsilon &lt; f(x) &lt; L + \epsilon$$</p>
<p>which would mean $\vert f(x) &#8211; L \vert &lt; \epsilon$. So what should we set $\delta$ to be so that if $0 &lt; \vert x &#8211; a \vert &lt; \delta$ then we get the three assumptions we want?</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; Seems like I have to start thinking now. After a bit of thought we see that we can let $\delta$ be any number that is positive, but less than (or equal) to both $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$. (If we want to get fancy we can set $\delta$ to be the smaller of the two numbers, i.e. $\delta = \min \{\delta_1, \delta_2 \}$.)</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! We&#8217;re done!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<strong>END OF PROOF</strong>]</p>
<p>So&#8230; was there a clever idea in that proof? Probably the only thing that required thought was our choice of $\delta$. Even then it was staring us right in the face.</p>
<p>The heart of this proof (i.e. the only thing that required any thinking) is the choice of $\delta = \min \{\delta_1, \delta_2 \}$. This is what I would write in my notes, and this is how I would think of this proof. In fact, if you talk to any third year math student and remind them that this is a &#8220;$\min \{\delta_1, \delta_2 \}$&#8221;-proof then they should instantly be able to start deriving it.</p>
<p>Notice how thinking about this proof in this way takes almost no space in your brain? That&#8217;s how we want to start thinking of proofs: Find the idea hidden in them. This also helps us to think of some proofs as being easy even though they might take an entire page of (brainless) calculations. In some ways, this is the key to learning science: discovering and identifying the key, important, clever ideas or perspectives for problems.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an <strong>exercise</strong> for you to try. Prove the following theorem, knowing that it is a &#8220;$\delta = \min \{\delta_1, \delta_2 \}$&#8221;-proof:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>. If $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x) = M$ then $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) + g(x) = L + M$.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the one (or zero or two) clever idea(s) in a proof. Think of the rest as brainless manipulation.</li>
<li>Judge the difficulty of a proof based on the cleverness of the ideas, not the length of brainless calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Playing with Proofs</h2>
<p>Before we get into a general method for reading proofs, let&#8217;s learn how to play around with proofs and theorems.</p>
<p>In our version of the Squeeze Theorem we assumed that our functions $u(x)$ and $l(x)$ were differentiable; did we use this anywhere? Is is possible that we could instead prove this theorem by only assuming that $u(x)$ and $l(a)$ were continuous? Maybe we can drop that requirement too? Are there other assumptions that we can weaken that still allow us to prove the same conclusion?</p>
<p>When we see a proof that of the form: &#8220;some assumptions&#8221; imply &#8220;some conclusions&#8221; we should always ask &#8220;Are some of these assumptions unnecessary? Can I get the same conclusions with fewer assumptions? Can I get better conclusions with the same conclusions?&#8221;</p>
<p>In our Squeeze Theorem we can see that assuming that $u(x)$ and $l(x)$ are merely functions (not necessarily continuous or differentiable) still allows us to get the same conclusion.</p>
<p>What assumptions cannot be weakened? In the case of the squeeze theorem we see that if we only assume that $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} l(x) = L &lt; U = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} u(x)$ and $l(x) &lt; f(x) &lt; u(x)$, then we can&#8217;t conclude anything about $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ &#8211; It could be that the limit doesn&#8217;t even exist! In this case we should try to find examples where we can&#8217;t get the conclusion. For example, take $a = 0, l(x) = -1, u(x) = 1$ and $f(x) = \sin (\frac{1}{x})$ (for $x \neq 0$, and $f(0) = 0$).</p>
<p>In problem sets this year we&#8217;ve tried to get you to think about theorems and proofs this way, but in the future you will need to be proactively thinking about theorems and proofs like this- We won&#8217;t hold your hand forever!</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. Play around with the theorem &#8220;A Gloop number of Snicks added together is a Gloop&#8221;. Prove it and then see that you can get a better theorem by using weaker assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for unneeded assumptions in theorems and try to use the same (or a similar) proof to get the same conclusion.</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t use the same proof with weaker assumptions then try to find an example where the conclusion fails.</li>
<li>Look through proofs to see if you can get stronger conclusions with the same assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reading Through a Proof</h2>
<p>As you progress through your mathematics education you will start to notice that proofs will get longer, more subtle and generally harder to understand. In your first calculus course you often saw 2 or 3 proofs in a single lecture. In some third-year and fourth-year course some proofs will take an entire lecture, week (or in some painful cases) an entire month. In these cases it becomes increasingly important to break down a proof in to manageable chunks. There is an old saying: &#8220;How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to lay out a couple of guidelines. Don&#8217;t think of this as an algorithm for reading proofs, but as a series of useful strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what the words in the theorem mean. (Look up definitions!)</li>
<li>Understand what the conclusion of the theorem says.</li>
<li>Reword the theorem into everyday language.</li>
<li>Try to draw a picture of the theorem (if possible).</li>
<li>Decide if you think the assumptions are reasonable or too strong. (The theorem &#8220;Every pet hedgehog that belongs to Mike is pokey.&#8221; has assumptions that are too strong; Hedgehogs should probably be pokey even if they don&#8217;t belong to Mike.)</li>
<li>Think of examples that satisfy the assumptions of the theorem. Do they also satisfy the conclusion?</li>
<li>Think of really weird examples that satisfy the assumptions of the theorem. Do they also satisfy the conclusion?</li>
<li>Think of even weirder examples. (Seriously, think of a ton of diverse examples before you go to a proof.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing to notice is that we have spent a long time just thinking about the statement of the theorem, even before we start trying to understand a proof.</p>
<p>Our next step is to make guesses (again before having looked at the proof)</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a guess as to the proof format. (Direct, Contrapostive, proof by contradiction, Induction.)</li>
<li>Write down what you think are the first two or three lines of the proof.</li>
<li>Keep writing down lines until you get stuck. (Hopefully now you understand more about the theorem.)</li>
<li>If possible, try to prove the theorem in special cases (while trying to avoid using anything special about the special case).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can take a look at the proof. (Notice how much work we&#8217;ve already done!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a quick overview of the proof.</li>
<li>Identify what the format of the proof is.</li>
<li>Identify the key proof-specific definitions used.</li>
<li>Identify which portions of the proof are brainless definition unwinding and which parts are clever ideas.</li>
<li>Break the proof down into smaller chunks. (Usually chunks will be of the form &#8220;Claim-Proof of Claim&#8221;.)</li>
<li>Try again to prove each of the claims on your own.</li>
<li>Go through each claim and do a line-by-line analysis. Try to identify which lines you don&#8217;t believe. (These are good questions to ask!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve done this and you&#8217;re still stuck. You just don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on. Here&#8217;s the strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a specific example that you know fails the conclusion of the theorem.</li>
<li>Go through the proof line-by-line and try to do what the proof tells you to do with your specific example.</li>
<li>When the proof stops working you will have a better understanding of the proof.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait a couple days then try to prove the theorem again.</li>
<li>Try writing the theorem in a different format. Don&#8217;t like the way this are positioned? See if you can switch it up.</li>
<li>Explain the theorem and proof to your grandmother.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Specific Example &#8211; The Alternating Series Test</h2>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s a big list of things. Let&#8217;s see how this applies to a specific example. Recall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_series_test#Proof_.5B1.5D">the Alternating Series Test</a>, which says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Theorem</strong>. If $(a_n)$ is a positive, decreasing sequence of real numbers that converges to $0$, then $\sum (-1)^n a_n$ converges.</p>
<p>Ok, so let&#8217;s see: Do we understand what a positive, decreasing sequence is? Do we know what it means for a sequence to converge to $0$? What are some good examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\sum \frac{(-1)^n}{n^2}$ we know converges and satisfies all the requirements.</li>
<li>$\sum \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$ is a weird example because we know that $\sum \frac{1}{n}$ diverges.</li>
<li>$\sum (-1)^n$ is a mischievious example that we know does not converge. (The terms don&#8217;t go to $0$ though.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The assumptions in the theorem seem reasonable because we know many examples of positive, decreasing sequences converging to $0$.</p>
<p>This theorem is saying that for an alternating series, to check convergence we only need to check that the terms go to $0$. This is in sharp contrast to $\sum \frac{1}{n}$ which is a series where the terms go to $0$, but the series itself diverges. Why does the $(-1)^n$ matter? Maybe it is giving us some cancellation?</p>
<p>We think the proof will probably just be a direct proof. Writing down the first couple lines of a proof will either lead us to getting stuck, or we might realize that even partial sums and odd partial sums matter.</p>
<p>Trying to prove special case is a bit tricky, and we will often make false proofs. Remember the &#8220;proof&#8221; that $$0 = (1-1)+(1-1)+ \ldots = 1-1+1-1 + \ldots = 1 + (-1+1) + (-1+1) + \ldots = 1$$ So we need to be careful.</p>
<p>Now looking at the proof we see that we can break the proof up roughly into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the partial sums with even index.
<ul>
<li>Show that these converge using the monotonic bounded sequence theorem.
<ul>
<li>Show that it is decreasing.</li>
<li>Show that it is positive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look at the partial sums with odd index.
<ul>
<li>Use the fact that consecutive partial sums only differ by an $a_n$.</li>
<li>Look at the limit of differences of consecutive partial sums.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The clever idea really seems to be break the series up into even index partial sums and odd index partial sums.</p>
<p>When I went through this proof I got really stuck. I just couldn&#8217;t believe it! It seemed like the proof proved that $\sum (-1)^n$ converges! When I went through the proof slowly I saw exactly where the $\lim a_n = 0$ was used.</p>
<h2>The Proof Philosophy</h2>
<p>Be skeptical. Be ornery. Be obstinate. Be careful. Be stubborn.</p>
<p>Every proof you see should be air-tight and you should be extremely skeptical while learning them. Assume that the professor, or textbook, or website that is showing you the proof is filled with lies, some subtle, some overt. Don&#8217;t accept arguments based on authority (&#8220;I&#8217;m a smart person. Believe me.&#8221;) and only accept a proof if you understand every line of the proof.</p>
<p>Keep a checklist of every theorem and fact you&#8217;ve used in your first year calculus course. There should be checkmarks next to all of the theorems. Shockingly there aren&#8217;t! There won&#8217;t be a checkmark next to one thing: The Intermediate Value theorem. &#8220;Pfft! So what?&#8221; So what?! You use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove the Extreme Value Theorem, the Mean Value Theorem and these are used to prove various other theorems in calculus. What if the Intermediate Value Theorem is false?!</p>
<p>Well you&#8217;ll be happy to know that it is indeed true (&#8220;I&#8217;m a smart person. I&#8217;ve seen it. Believe me.&#8221;) but the tools needed to prove it are developped in a second year calculus course.</p>
<p>This extremely skeptical attitude seems bizarre, but it is very liberating. All of a sudden you are no longer the powerless victim. You, yes you, are now the arbiter of truth. You get to decide if you should believe something. You get to ask for more evidence. You get to confront the establishment.</p>
<p>Now, go and be free. Get stuck. Struggle. Succeed. Prove some stuff. You can do it.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The material in here is fairly comprehensive. Comments in <font color="#FF0000">red</font> describe the sources that I suggest you start with. <a href="australia.html">Back to main seminars page</a>.</p>
<p>Background on <b>expanders</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li> Hoory, Linial, Wigderson, <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nati/PAPERS/expander_survey.pdf">Expander graphs and their applications</a>. 120 pages.
<li> Linial, Wigderson, <a href="http://www.math.ias.edu/~boaz/ExpanderCourse/">Lecture notes</a>. I belive the previous link is a more up-to-date version of these notes.
<li>Nielsen, <a href="http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/notes/expander_graphs.pdf">Notes on expander graphs</a>. Also in <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/expander-graphs-i-introduction/">blog format</a>.
<li> Davidoff, Sarnak, Valette, <i>Elementary Number Theory, Group Theory, and Ramanujan Graphs</i>. <font color="#FF0000">The Overview and Chapter 1 of this book give a good grounding in the basics of expanders.</font>
</ul>
</p>
<p>On the <b>sum-product</b> phenomenon. The basic text is Tao and Vu &#8220;Additive Combinatorics&#8221;. Here are a few other links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2075">Sum-product over F_p</a>. This is a survey article.
<li>Green, <a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~bjg23/AddCombinatorics/notes7.pdf">Sum-product over the complexes</a>. This focusses on Solymosi&#8217;s result.
<li>Bourgain, Katz, Tao, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0301343">Sum-product over F_p</a>. This is the first proof of sum-product over F_p. However it is difficult so I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it as a first read. Plus it is not completely general (it doesn&#8217;t work for very small sets). On the plus side it very clearly demonstrates the connection between sum-product phenomena and Szemeredi-Trotter theorems. So it&#8217;s worth looking at for this reason.
<li>Helfgott, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2027">Growth in SL_3</a>. Section 3 of this paper is devoted to a generalization of <i>the idea of</i> the sum-product theorem. It is based on the Glibichuk-Konyagin sum-product theorem over F_p (which works for small sets so improves the work of BKT mentioned above), but is couched in much more general terms; the statement involves one group acting upon another. <font color="#FF0000">This is the key statement of the sum-product phenomenon for our purposes; the exposition is excellent.</font>
<li> Tao and Vu, <i>Additive Combinatorics</i>. <font color="#FF0000">To get a taste of how incidence theorems are related to the sum-product phenomenon read Sections 8.1-8.3.</font>
</ul>
<p>On <b>growth in non-abelian groups</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helfgott, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2027">Growth in SL_3</a>. This paper is central. It includes a discussion of key ideas including escape, non-singularity, sticking subgroups in different directions, bounds on torus intersection, bounds on conjugacy classes, use of incidence theorems etc. The statement of Theorem 1.1 is &#8220;ideal&#8221; (as this is currently understood); it reduces questions of growth to the nilpotent setting.
<p><font color="#FF0000">Sections 4 and 5 of this paper are particularly vital. Subsequent sections of the paper use incidence theorems; we will be able to go to the full result more directly.</font></p>
<li>Breuillard, Green, Tao, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4570">Growth in Chevalley groups</a>. This is an announcement of the general result which focusses on the pivot argument. <font color="#FF0000">A full proof of this result does not yet exist in the literature. So for now the best exposition of the result is <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/01/27/linear-approximate-groups/">this blog entry of Tao</a> (see also the subsequent discussion, especially the simplifications described by Helfgott).</font>
<li>Pyber, Szabo, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4556">Growth in groups of Lie type</a>. The methods in this paper are similar to those of the previous link. However the statement is more general (it holds for twisted groups). In addition examples are given that justify the dependency of the constant epsilon on the rank.
<li>Larsen, Pink, <a href="http://www.math.ethz.ch/~pink/ftp/LP5.pdf">Subgroups of algebraic groups</a>. This paper contains material that was central to adapting Helfgott&#8217;s work to the general setting (a la the previous two points).
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Expanders from groups</b>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Bourgain, Gamburd, <a href="http://annals.princeton.edu/annals/2008/167-2/p07.xhtml">Expanders in SL_2(p)</a>. This uses Helfgott&#8217;s result on growth in SL_2(p) to generate expanders. These two clever people have a couple of other papers that are also of interest:
<ul>
<li>    J. Bourgain and A. Gamburd, Expansion and random walks in<br />
    SLd (Z/pn Z):I, J. Eur. Math. Soc. 10 (2008), 987-1011.</p>
<li> J. Bourgain and A. Gamburd,<br />
    SLd (Z/pn Z):II, preprint
</ul>
<li>Varju, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3664">Expansion in SL_d</a> This generalizes some of the work of Bourgain and Gamburd.
<li>Kassabov, Nikolov, Lubotzky, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0510562">Finite simple groups as expanders</a>. An entirely different set of techniques.
<li>Kassabov, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0505624">Symmetric groups as expanders</a>. Another entirely different set of techniques.
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Sieving</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bourgain, Gamburd, Sarnak, <a href="www.math.princeton.edu/sarnak/sespM8.pdf">Affine linear sieve, expanders, and sum-product</a>. Using expansion results to <i>sieve</i>. The latter activity being something number theorists are particularly fond of.
<li>Green, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3354">Linear approximate groups and connections</a>. A survey article which, amongst other things, discusses the the work of BGS on the sieve.
</ul>
<p><b>Property T</b>: The first construction of expander graphs was by Margulis and used property T, a representation theoretic property that holds for certain discrete groups (SL_d(Z) with d&gt;2 for instance).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazhdan's_property_(T)">Wikipedia</a> gives a definition of Property T.
<li>A. Lubotzky. <i>Discrete groups, expanding graphs and invariant measures</i>, volume 125 of Progress in Mathematics. This book outlines (amongst other things) the connection between Property T and expansion properties.

We introduce the idea of growth in groups, before focussing on the abelian<br />
setting. We take a first look at the sum-product principle, with a brief<br />
foray into the connection between sum-product results and incidence<br />
theorems.
</p>
<p>
We then focus on Helfgott&#8217;s restatement of the sum-product principle in<br />
terms of groups acting on groups.
</p>
<li><b>Growth in groups of Lie type</b> (11am, Fri 7 May 2010; <a href="http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/overview.pdf">notes now available</a>)
<p>
Since Helfgott first proved that &#8220;generating sets grow&#8221; in SL_2(p) and<br />
SL_3(p), our understanding of how to prove such results has developed a<br />
great deal. It is now possible to prove that generating sets grow in any<br />
finite group of Lie type; what is more the most recent proofs are very<br />
direct &#8211; they have no recourse to the incidence theorems of Helfgott&#8217;s<br />
original approach.
</p>
<p>
We give an overview of this new approach, which has come to be known as a<br />
&#8220;pivotting argument&#8221;. There are five parts to this approach, and we<br />
outline how these fit together.
</p>
<li><b>Escape</b> (11am, Fri 14 May 2010); <a>notes now available</a>)
<p>
The principle of &#8220;escape from subvarieties&#8221; is the first step in proving<br />
growth in groups of Lie type. We give a proof of this result, and its most<br />
important application (for us) &#8211; the construction of regular semisimple<br />
elements.
</p>
<p>
We then examine other related ideas from algebraic geometry, in particular<br />
the idea of non-singularity.
</p>
<li><b>Growth in soluble subgroups of <i>GL_r(p)</i></b> (11am, Wed 21 Jul 2010; notes will not be written up for this &#8211; a preprint will appear on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+Nick+Gill/0/1/0/all/0/1">arXiv</a> in due course.)
<p>
We show how to reduce the study of exponential growth in<br />
soluble subgroups of <i>GL_r(p)</i> to the nilpotent setting. We make use of ideas based on the sum-product phenomenon, as well as some machinery from linear algebraic groups. We will not assume any background from these areas. This lecture is based on new results of the lecturer and Helfgott.
</p>
<li><b>An introduction to expanders</b> (11am, Fri 23 Jul 2010; <a href="http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/expanders1.pdf">notes now available</a>)
<p>
This is a background lecture preparing the way for the final lecture, where we<br />
connect results on growth in simple groups to the explicit construction of<br />
families of expanders. In this lecture we will define what we mean by a<br />
family of expanders, stating (and sometimes even proving!!) background<br />
results that will be important later.
</p>
<p>
We will also try to explain why expanders are of such interest to so many<br />
different groups of people.
</p>
<li><b>Using growth results to explicitly construct expanders</b> (1pm, Tue 27 Jul 2010; <a href="http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/expanders2.pdf">notes now available</a>)
<p>
We outline the method of Bourgain and Gamburd. They were the<br />
first to use<br />
results concerning growth in simple groups to explicitly construct<br />
expander graphs. Let <i>S</i> be a set in <i>SL_2(Z)</i> and define <i>S_p</i> to be the<br />
natural projection of <i>S</i> modulo <i>p</i>. Now let <i>G_p</i> be the Cayley graph of<br />
<i>SL_2(p)</i> with respect to the set <i>S_p</i>. Bourgain and Gamburd give precise<br />
results as to when the set of graphs <i>{G_p : p a prime}</i> forms a family of<br />
expanders. They make crucial use of the result of Helfgott (encountered in Seminar 2) which states that &#8220;all generating sets in <i>SL_2(p)</i><br />
grow&#8221;.</p>]]></summary>

I sent the following email to the <i>Journal of Algebra</i> on 16 October 2009. I know I&#8217;m not the only one who has decided to refuse to give references for Elsevier journals. (This article gives an idea <a href="http://infochangeindia.org/200806107173/Technology/Features/Knowledge-for-all.html">why</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Dear Prof ***,
</p>
<p>
&gt; Manuscript Reference Number: ***<br />
&gt; Manuscript Title: ***
</p>
<p>
Ordinarily I would be very pleased to write a reference for this paper &#8211;<br />
it certainly sounds like it would be of interest to me.
</p>
<p>
However I have been talking to a few people here in Bristol about journal<br />
prices, and there is a lot of discontent at Elsevier&#8217;s policies in this<br />
area. It has been suggested to me that there should be a referee&#8217;s boycott<br />
of Elsevier, for as long as they continue to charge astronomical prices.<br />
I&#8217;m inclined to agree with this position, and have taken a personal<br />
decision to refuse requests for references for Elsevier journals.
</p>
<p>
Please be assured that my position is not meant as a criticism, in any<br />
way, of the academics who publish in, and edit, the Journal of Algebra. It<br />
is an excellent journal and one with which, but for this issue of pricing,<br />
I would be pleased to be associated.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the fact that the Journal of Algebra (amongst others) has such an<br />
excellent academic reputation makes it all the more disappointing that its<br />
owners choose to market it in such a mercenary way.
</p>
<p>
Very best wishes,<br />
Nick Gill</p>]]></summary>

<h2>Class 1 &#8211; Ramsey&#8217;s Theorems</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4qYJArwuPtyY2xtVTBzcUIwVUE/edit?usp=sharing">Notes for Class 1 [PDF]</a></p>
<p>Here we look at the classical Ramsey&#8217;s Theorems from 1930. We prove the infinite version (of the classical theorem) along the way to proving Ramsey&#8217;s theorem that there are &#8220;only&#8221; 8 binary relations on $\N$. We then prove the finite version of Ramsey&#8217;s Theorem from the infinite version by using an ultraproduct.</p>

<h2>Class 2 &#8211; Nash-Williams Theorem</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4qYJArwuPtyd2ZKbkNIVndHNVk/edit?usp=sharing">Notes for Class 2 [PDF]</a></p>
<p>We introduce the notion of combinatorial forcing in order to prove that every Nash-Williams family is a Ramsey family. The main idea is to look at combinatorial properties of finite subsets of $\N$. Furthermore, we look at the notion of blocks and barriers to discuss an analogous theorem of Galvin.</p>

<h2>Class 3 &#8211; Partitions of Infinite Dimensional Ramsey Spaces</h2>

<p>The main object that we study here is $\N^{[\infty]}$, the infinite subsets of $\N$. Given the Ellentuck topology, this is an infinite dimensional Ramsey space. The main result involves investigating (and sometimes equating) the notions of open, meager, Ramsey and nowhere dense in this topology.</p>

<p>We introduce left-ideals of semigroups and point out a handful of straightforward properties of them. This is used to prove the Galvin-Glazer theorem, from which Hindman&#8217;s theorem follows immediately.</p>

<h1><span id="more-1088"></span>The Ramsey Games</h1>
<h2>Game 1 &#8211; Four points</h2>
<p>Take four points and put them in a square. By attaching a blue edge or a red edge between each pair of points try to make a configuartion that is &#8220;as chaotic as possible&#8221;. Whoa! Hold on, I should be careful what I&#8217;m saying. You might just try <a href="http://thumbs.imagekind.com/2778426_650/Red--Blue-scribbles.jpg%3Fv%3D1278501300">this</a> (Artist: <a href="http://paintingsbygretzky.com/">gretzky</a> ). Well, whatever, interpret &#8220;chaos&#8221; however you want, this first time.</p>
<p>Okay, let me give you a bit more guidance. Draw 4 more points, and this time, by &#8220;chaos&#8221; I mean: &#8220;try to avoid patterns&#8221;. Interpret that however you like.</p>
<p>Go ahead, don&#8217;t be shy.</p>
<p>Now, go ahead and look at your beautiful art. Does it have any blue &#8220;triangles&#8221; or red &#8220;triangles&#8221;? Here by &#8220;red triangle&#8221; I mean three points where all 3 edges between the three points are red.</p>
<p>If yours has a red triangle or a blue triangle try again! See if you can find a configuration without a red triangle or a blue triangle.</p>
<p>If yours does not have a red triangle or a blue triangle, then you have discovered a very chaotic arrangment! You have found an arrangment that doesn&#8217;t have the &#8220;triangle&#8221; pattern.</p>
<h2>Game 2 &#8211; Five Points</h2>
<p>Now before we go on, I need to simplify the words &#8220;blue triangle or red triangle&#8221;. Rather than say &#8220;blue or red triangle&#8221; I will say mono-chromatic triangle (etymology: Greek: mono meaning one, chrome meaning colour).</p>
<p>Ok, now draw 5 points on your sheet and try to avoid monochromatic triangles.</p>
<p>This is definitely a bit trickier, as now there are just way more edges (how many more?) that are trying to foil you. It can be done though! If you can&#8217;t get one of the chaotic patterns for this one, don&#8217;t sweat it. I&#8217;ll show you a chaotic arrangement later. (By the way, the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chaos&amp;allowed_in_frame=0">etymology for &#8220;Chaos&#8221;</a> is neat! )</p>
<h2>Game 3 &#8211; Six Points</h2>
<p>Alright, let&#8217;s get to the main point. Try this again with 6 points (&#8220;Mike, you&#8217;re killing me&#8230;&#8221;). Try to avoid triangles this time!</p>
<p>Well, this time it&#8217;s actually impossible! No matter how you try to put the edges in you will always end up with a monochromatic triangle. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem#Example:_R.283.2C3.29_.3D_6">You can find a (beautiful) proof here</a>, but the thing to realize is that if we have too many things (edges in this case) then patterns always show up (triangles in this case). This is a way in which absolute chaos is impossible.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we have too many things then patterns always show up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take this cool fact in a couple of different directions:</p>
<h3>What is a &#8220;real world&#8221; application of this?</h3>
<p>In any group of six people you can always find 3 people who have all spoken to each other before (friends), or who have never spoken to each other (strangers).</p>
<h3>What are some other questions that are related to this?</h3>
<ul>
<li>What happens when we have 7 points? 8 points? A million points?</li>
<li>What happens when we add a third colour?</li>
<li>What happens if we try to only avoid patterns that are more complicated than triangles? For example what if we try to avoid &#8220;cubes&#8221; or &#8220;tetrahedrons&#8221;?</li>
</ul>
<p>These turn out to get really complicated really quickly! Here are some easier questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many edges are there when we completely draw in an arrangement with six points?</li>
<li>How many different ways are there to colour the edges red and blue? Would it be feasible to get a computer to check all of these configurations?</li>
<li>Can you write a computer program that checks an arrangement for monochromatic triangles?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all good questions. A good place to start investigating this is on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem">Wikipedia article for Ramsey&#8217;s Theorem</a>.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s turn this into a game!</h3>
<p>This can be turned into a game called Sim. The idea is that one player plays red edges, and the other plays blue edges. If you make a triangle of your colour: You lose!</p>
<p>You can read more about that game on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_%28pencil_game%29">Wikipedia Article for the Sim Game</a>.</p>
<h1>Different kinds of Chaos</h1>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at chaos from a similar, related, but different perspective. Here&#8217;s the so-called Pigeonhole Principle:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you try to put 7 pigeons into 6 boxes, then there will be (at least one) box with (at least two) pigeons in it.</p>
<p>An equivalent statement is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">There is no way to place 7 pigeons into 6 boxes so that each box has 0 or 1 pigeon in it.</p>
<p>Of course, 7 and 6 aren&#8217;t the important things here, and we get the &#8220;real&#8221; Pigeonhole Principle here:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have more pigeons than boxes, and try to put the pigeons in the boxes, then you will have a box with at least two pigeons in it.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a kind of remarkable theorem. It seems completely obvious, but turns out to show up in all sorts of neat applications!</p>
<h2>First some &#8220;cute&#8221; applications!</h2>
<p><strong>Fact 1</strong>: There are two (non-bald) people in Toronto with the same number of hairs on their head.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. The internet tells me that there are ~ 2.5 million people in Toronto and each person has less than 250 000 hairs on their head (average is about ~100 000).</p>
<p>So what are our pigeons and boxes?</p>
<p>The pigeons will be the people in Toronto, and the boxes will be the number of hairs on a person&#8217;s head. Since 250000 &lt; 2.5 million there must be a box with at least two people in it. So those two people must have the same number of hairs on their head. [<strong>END</strong>]</p>
<p>This raises some interesting questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this a convincing proof? Should I believe it?</li>
<li>Is it practical to accomplish? Does that matter in a &#8220;good&#8221; proof?</li>
<li>Is there a proof of this fact that is feasible to actually carry out?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact 2</strong>: If 27 Canadian teachers show up to workshop, at least 3 of them will be from the same province or territory.</p>
<p>This suggests a more powerful pigeonhole principle. In the above fact we see that since $13 \cdot 2 &lt; 27$, then there must be a province that has at least 3 representatives.</p>
<p>Trying to actually extract the precise statement of this generalized pigeonhole principle is a nice exercise. For reference, here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we have $N$ pigeonholes and at least $N \cdot K+1$ pigeons each in a pigeonhole, THEN there is a pigeonhole with at least $K+1$ pigeons in it.</p></blockquote>
<p>From these pigeonhole principle statements we start to get a sense of how adding a lot of objects (or pigeons) increases the strength or frequency of the relationships of those objects.</p>
<h2>A challenging problem involving the Pigeonhole principle</h2>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>. Kane solved 45 math problems in November, and he solved at least one a day. Show that there was a streak of days where he solved exactly 14 problems.</p>
<p><strong>SOL</strong>. There is a clever idea hidden in here that is also useful for efficient coding. If you have a list of 30 things (like amount of problems solved in a day) and need to keep track of the sum of consecutive things you only need to keep track of sums starting from the beginning.</p>
<p>e.g. $d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2 + d_3, \ldots, d_1 + d_2 + \ldots + d_{30}$</p>
<p>Now if $d_i$ is the amount of problems solved on day $i$ and $s_i = d_1 + \ldots + d_i$, then to figure out how many problems solved between day $i$ and day $j$ we only need to look at $s_j &#8211; s_i = d_{i+1} + \ldots + d_{j}$.</p>
<p>Back to our problem, we need to find $i,j$ between 1 and 30 so that $s_j &#8211; s_i = 14$. Or in other words, $s_j = s_i + 14$.</p>
<p>Notice first that since Kane solves at least one problem a day, we have: $$1 \leq s_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; s_{30} = 45$$ and so also, $$15 \leq s_1 +14 &lt; s_2 + 14 &lt; \ldots &lt; s_{30} + 14 = 59$$</p>
<p>Now, we notice that the 60 numbers $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{30}, s_1 + 14, s_2 + 14, \ldots, s_{30} + 14$ must all be between 1 and $59$. By the pigeonhole principle there must be two that are equal. Our previous inequalities tell us that it must be one of the $s_i$ and one the $s_j + 14$. As desired.</p>

<p>The pigeonhole principle is a remarkable combinatorial theorem that looks silly and obvious, but turns out to be quite powerful and useful, especially in the context of contest problem solving. I&#8217;m going to present a couple of statements of the pigeonhole principle, then I&#8217;ll give some broad applications of it. I&#8217;ll end off with a list of problems.</p>
<div style="width: 482px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R1BG4mngDfE/T6VBztZatZI/AAAAAAAAAT0/taFTqpHBaqc/s1600/Cas_0136sm.jpg" width="472" height="472" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Found them!</p></div>
<p><span id="more-1074"></span></p>
<h2>The Statements</h2>
<p>We start off with the most basic statement of the Pigeonhole Principle:</p>
<blockquote><p>(<strong>BPHP</strong>) For $N$ a positive natural number (think number of pigeonholes) if $N+1$ (or more) pigeons are each put in a pigeonhole, THEN there must be at least one of the pigeonholes that has at least 2 pigeons in it.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>. Say you ate 8 pieces of cake last week. Then there must have been a day where you ate 2 pieces of cake. (Assuming you ate whole pieces of cake.) Here the &#8216;7 days of the week&#8217; are the pigeonholes and the &#8216;8 pieces of cake&#8217; are the pigeons.</p>
<div style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://bemissstrong.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/misstrong45.jpg" width="420" height="279" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Eating 8 pieces of cake in a week is not good for you.</p></div>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>. There are two people in Toronto that have the same number of hairs on their (respective) heads. First some quick facts: A person has less than 250 000 hairs on their head (average is about ~100 000), and there are ~ 2.5 million people in Toronto. So to each person in Toronto we associate the number of hairs on their head, and the BPHP tells us that there are at least 2 people with the same number of hairs. (This example was inspired by Presh Talwalkar&#8217;s example.)</p>
<div style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9fp4kMjf9i0/ToVHM-6iVAI/AAAAAAAAAM0/HGpioYq4i6o/s640/Style_Gallery_Full_0002_2.jpg" width="315" height="385" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hair!</p></div>
<p>Notice that the BPHP doesn&#8217;t tell us anything about <em>which</em> hole gets two pigeons, it just tells us that there is such a hole. In the second example we don&#8217;t know anything about which two people have the same number of hairs. These types of theorems are sometimes called &#8216;existential theorems&#8217; because they prove that something exists but they don&#8217;t provide a method for finding what we&#8217;re looking for. This can be a good thing though! We have given up some precision for power.</p>
<p>Expanding on the BPHP we can get better estimates on our final declaration about how many pigeons are in one of the holes. Before I state the more general PHP, here&#8217;s an example.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong>. If you ate 22 grapes last week, then there was a day where you ate at least 4 grapes.</p>
<div style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://www.lib-art.com/imgpainting/2/9/5592-bacchus-with-attendant-putti-baldassarre-franceschini.jpg" width="574" height="360" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Bacchus with Attendant Putti by Baldassarre Franceschini c. 1670</p></div>
<p>Stating this in a general way we have:</p>
<blockquote><p>(<strong>GPHP</strong>) If we have $N$ pigeonholes and at least $N \cdot K + 1$ pigeons each in a pigeonhole, THEN there is a pigeonhole with at least $K+1$ pigeons in it.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong>. If 27 Canadians show up to a math contest, at least 3 of them will be from the same province or territory (remembering that there are 10 provinces and 3 territories).</p>
<div style="width: 395px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img alt="" src="http://www.jaunted.com/files/16133/RCMP_385.jpg" width="385" height="257" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I bet they&#8217;re all from Yukon too&#8230;</p></div>
<p>The GPHP can be stated in an even more general way which turns out to be quite useful. This Average PHP was stated by Dijkstra (although it must certainly have been stated before):</p>
<blockquote><p>(<strong>APHP</strong>) The maximum value of a function is at least its average.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is really a restatement of the GPHP but the advantage is that it no longer references &#8216;pigeons&#8217; and &#8216;pigeonholes&#8217; (or &#8216;objects&#8217; and &#8216;boxes&#8217;).</p>
<h2>Example Problems</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m going to list 5 example problems that you can look over and think about, then I will post solutions below in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>EP1</strong>. For any subset $A \sse \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\}$ with 6 elements, there are two different elements $a,b \in A$ such that $a + b = 11$. (Inspired by Gary MacGillivray&#8217;s writeup.)</p>
<p><strong>EP2</strong>. Given a set $A \sse \{1, 2, &#8230;, 100\}$ of ten integers. Prove that it is possible to select two disjoint non-empty subsets of $A$, $S$ and $T$, whose members have the same sum. (Problem 22 from CTK.)</p>
<p><strong>EP3</strong>. In a gymnasium with 2014 people, there are at least two people that have the same number of friends in the room. (Note if Mike is a friend of Janet, then Janet is a friend of Mike. Also, no person is a friend of themselves.) (Problem from folklore.)</p>
<p><strong>EP4</strong>. Mike solved 45 <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems in November, and he solved at least one a day. Show that there was a streak of days where he solved exactly 14 problems. (Problem from folklore.)</p>
<p><strong>EP5</strong>. Let $P$ be a non-degenerate pentagon whose vertices lie on the integer lattice. Show that there is an integer lattice point in the interior of $P$. (This appeared on a Putnam Contest, but I don&#8217;t know which one.)</p>
<h2>Example Problem Solutions</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>EP1</strong>. For any subset $A \sse \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\}$ with 6 elements, there are elements (possibly only one element) of $A$ such that sum to 11.</p>
<p><strong>SOL</strong>. If $A$ contains the number 11, then we are finished, so suppose it doesn&#8217;t. Consider the pigeonholes: $\{1,10\},\{2,9\},\{3,8\},\{4,7\},\{5,6\}$. Notice the elements of each pigeonhole sum to 11. Since $A$ has 6 elements, by the BPHP one of the pigeonholes contains two elements of $A$, which must sum to 11.</p>
<p><strong>Followup</strong>. Formulate a similar problem (with the appropriate size of $A$, and length of $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$) such that there is always a subset of $A$ with at least two elements that adds up to an odd number.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>EP2</strong>. Given a set $A \sse \{1, 2, &#8230;, 100\}$ of ten integers. Prove that it is possible to select two disjoint non-empty subsets of $A$, $S$ and $T$, whose members have the same sum. (Problem 22 from CTK.)</p>
<p><strong>SOL</strong>. Note that the largest possible sum of elements of $A$ is $92 + 93 + \ldots + 99 + 100 = 864$, and the smallest is $1$. Thus there are at most $864$ possible sums for subsets of $A$. However, there are $2^{10} &#8211; 1 = 1023$ ways of partitioning $A$ into two non-empty disjoint subsets. So by the BPHP there are two different, non-empty subsets of $A$, named $S$ and $T$, such that they have the same sum.</p>
<p>We are not finished yet though, because $S$ and $T$ need not be disjoint. A little bit of thinking quickly reveals that removing the common intersection of $S$ and $T$ from each set yields the desired pair.</p>
<p><strong>Followup</strong>. Prove that this can also be done with $A$ having size 9.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>EP3</strong>. In a gymnasium with 2014 people, there are at least two people that have the same number of friends in the room.</p>
<p><strong>SOL</strong>. There are two cases to consider: (1) everyone has at least 1 friend, and (2) there is someone with no friends.</p>
<p>(1) Here each person has between 1 and 2013 friends. To each person we associate their number of friends. By the BPHP there will be two people with the same number of friends.</p>
<p>(2) Now everyone has between 0 and 2012 friends. So again by the BPHP there are two people with the same number of friends.</p>
<p><strong>Followup</strong>. Ten baseball teams are entered in a round-robin touranment (meaning that every team plays every other team exactly once) in which ties are not allowed. Prove that if no team loses all of its games, then some two teams finish the tournament with the same number of wins. (Taken from Gary MacGillivray&#8217;s handout.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>EP4</strong>. Mike solved 45 project Euler problems in November, and he solved at least one a day. Show that there was a streak of days where he solved exactly 14 problems.</p>
<p><strong>SOL</strong>. There is a clever idea hidden in here that is also useful for efficient coding. If you have a list of 30 things (like amount of problems solved in a day) and need to keep track of the sum of consecutive things you only need to keep track of sums <em>starting from the beginning</em>.</p>
<p>e.g. $d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2 + d_3, \ldots, d_1 + d_2 + \ldots + d_{30}$</p>
<p>Now if $d_i$ is the amount of problems solved on day $i$ and $s_i = d_1 + \ldots + d_i$, then to figure out how many problems solved between day $i$ and day $j$ we only need to look at $s_j &#8211; s_i = d_{i+1} + \ldots + d_{j}$.</p>
<p>Back to our problem, we need to find $i,j$ between 1 and 30 so that $s_j &#8211; s_i = 14$. Or in other words, $s_j = s_i + 14$.</p>
<p>Notice first that since Mike solves at least one problem a day, we have: $$1 \leq s_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; s_{30} = 45$$ and so also, $$15 \leq s_1 +14 &lt; s_2 + 14 &lt; \ldots &lt; s_{30} + 14 = 59$$</p>
<p>Now, we notice that the 60 numbers $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{30}, s_1 + 14, s_2 + 14, \ldots, s_{30} + 14$ must all be between 1 and $59$. By the BPHP there must be two that are equal. Our previous inequalities tell us that it must be one of the $s_i$ and one the $s_j + 14$. As desired.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>EP5</strong>. Let $P$ be a non-degenerate, convex pentagon whose vertices lie on the integer lattice. Show that there is an integer lattice point in the interior of $P$.</p>
<p><strong>SOL</strong>. Suppose this isn&#8217;t true, and take $P$ to be a counterexample with a minimal number of integer lattice points in $P$. (We could try taking one of minimal area, but it isn&#8217;t immediately clear that such a thing should exist.) We will show that there is a related pentagon $P&#8217;$ that has smaller number of integer lattice points inside itself.</p>
<p>We are going to put the five vertices into four holes based on the parity of the coordinates. That is, the holes are {Even,Even}, {Odd, Odd}, {Even, Odd} and {Odd, Even}. By the BPHP there are two vertices $a$ and $b$ with the same &#8220;parity pair&#8221; (above). This tells us that their midpoint $m$ is again an integer lattice point. By convexity, it is inside $P$, by our assumption of $P$ being a counterexample, $m$ is on the boundary of $P$, and by our assumption of $P$ being non-degenerate that means that $a$ and $b$ are adjacent.</p>
<p>Thus if $P$ has vertices $a,b,c,d,e$ the related pentagon $P&#8217;$ given by $m,b,c,d,e$ will be a convex, non-degenerate pentagon containing fewer integer lattice points (namely we removed $a$).</p>
<h2>Other Problems</h2>
<p>Here is a small selection of nice problems that use a pigeonhole principle in one form or another.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 1</strong>. On a usual 8&#215;8 chessboard show that there is no way to place 33 pawns so that no two pawns are attacking each other.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2</strong>. (CTK 5) Suppose each point of the plane is coloured red or blue. Show that some rectangle has its vertices all the same color.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 3</strong>. (CTK 15) Given any sequence of $mn + 1$ real numbers, some subsequence of $(m + 1)$ numbers is increasing or some subsequence of $(n+1)$ numbers is decreasing.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4</strong>. (CTK 13) If more than half of the integers from $\{1, 2, &#8230;, 2n\}$ are selected, then some two of the selected integers have the property that one divides the other.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5</strong>. (Red Book 48) Let $m$ and $n$ be integers such that $1 \leq m &lt; n$. Let $A = \{a_{ij} : 1 \leq i \leq m, 1 \leq j \leq n\}$ be a collection of $mn$ integers (not all zero), and set $a$ to be the maximum of all $\vert a_{ij}\vert$. Prove that the following system of equations has a solution in the integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, not all zero, satisfying $\vert x_j \vert \leq(2na)^\frac{m}{n-m}$ for all $1 \leq j \leq n$:</p>
<ul>
<li>$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{1n}x_n = 0$</li>
<li>$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22} + \ldots + a_{2n}x_n = 0$</li>
<li>$\vdots$</li>
<li>$a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2} + \ldots + a_{mn}x_n = 0$</li>
</ul>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my main research problems involves something I think is related to arithmetic progressions in $\Z$. After learning a nice proof of Van der Waerden&#8217;s Theorem, and sharing it with colleagues, Daniel Soukup asked a nice question about Van der Waerden&#8217;s Theorem on $\omega_1$. We answered it, and the example was sufficiently nice that I would like to share it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1052"></span></p>
<h2>Van der Waerden&#8217;s Theorem</h2>
<p>First off let&#8217;s recall Van der Waerden&#8217;s Theorem, which was discovered <em>before</em> Ramsey&#8217;s famous theorem:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Van der Waerden&#8217;s Theorem (1926)</strong>. If the enemy colours the natural numbers using only finitely many colours, then one of the colours must contain an arbitrarily long (but finite) arithmetic progression.</p></blockquote>
<p>I learned that in the 50s Van der Waerden wrote an essay explaining his thought process as he discovered his proof. It is a wonderful essay about 8 pages in length and includes diagrams that he would have drawn on the chalkboard, special cases that help understanding, and the 5 important observations that lead to the proof. After reading this essay I really feel like I have <em>absorbed</em> the theorem, and I strongly recommend that people interested in Ramsey theory of the integers read it.</p>
<p>You can find a reproduction of the essay in Alexander Soifer&#8217;s 2009 book &#8220;<a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=Vn3GLf-4YkEC">The Mathematical Coloring Book</a>&#8220;.</p>
<h2>What about $\omega_1$?</h2>
<p>Since I was so excited about the proof, I shared it with a couple of friends including Ivan Khatchatourian and Daniel Soukup. After seeing the proof Daniel asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Question 1.</strong> Does Van der Waerden&#8217;s Theorem hold for $\omega_1$? In the simplest case, if the enemy colours the countable ordinals with finitely many colours, must there exist $\alpha, \beta \in \omega_1$ such that $\alpha, \alpha + \beta$ and $\alpha + 2 \beta$ all have the same colour?</p></blockquote>
<p>After understanding what the question says, it is pretty obvious that the answer is &#8220;Yes&#8221;, because the natural numbers still get coloured, so we can use the original Van der Waerden&#8217;s theorem. Okay, so let&#8217;s fix the question so that it is not a corollary:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Question 2.</strong> If the enemy colours the countable ordinals with <strong>countably</strong> many colours, must there exist $\alpha, \beta \in \omega_1$ such that $\alpha, \alpha + \beta$ and $\alpha + 2 \beta$ all have the same colour?</p></blockquote>
<p>There we go, now <em>this </em>is a problem.</p>
<p>It turns out (after some hemming and hawing) that the answer is &#8220;No&#8221;, there is a colouring of $\omega_1$ using countably many colours such that there are no &#8220;3 progressions&#8221; as described.</p>
<h2>The &#8220;C&#8221;</h2>
<p>Our original idea was actually to show that the theorem <em>did</em> hold using the pressing down lemma. This seemed plausible, and got us thinking about stationary and club sets. Eventually we stumbled on the following &#8220;problem club set&#8221; which turns out to give us the &#8220;bad&#8221; colouring.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fact.</strong> There is a (&#8220;stretched out&#8221;) club subset $C \sse \omega_1$ such that if $\alpha, \alpha + \beta &lt; c \in C$ then $\alpha + 2 \beta &lt; c$. (In one sense C is &#8220;inaccessible from below&#8221;.)</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many ways to get $C$, the slickest is to take an $\omega_1$ chain $\{C_\alpha : \alpha \in \omega_1\}$ of countable elementary submodels, and let $C := \{C_\alpha \cap \omega_1 : \alpha \in \omega_1\}$, the submodels&#8217; versions of $\omega_1$.</p>
<p>If this gives you chills, you can instead take $C$ to be the collection of all limit ordinals that are limits of limits of limits of limits of &#8230; ($\omega$ many times). This will also work.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you get such a $C$, let&#8217;s show that there is a countable colouring on it that breaks Van der Waerden&#8217;s theorem.</p>
<h2>The Colouring</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s colour all of the elements of $C$ with colour $0$, and then for any $c \in C$, we know that the interval between $c$ and the next element of $C$ is countable, so colour the points in that interval in any injective way (without using the colour $0$).</p>

<p>Now we see that if we take any two elements $\alpha, \alpha + \beta \in \omega_1$ and let $c \in C$ be the minimum value of $C$ above both we get that $\alpha + 2\beta &lt; c$ so the colours of $\alpha + \beta$ and $\alpha + 2 \beta$ must be different.</p>
