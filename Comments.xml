        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am wondering whether we might be able to make a drawing strategy for the first player using a similar idea. My proposal is that player one will aim to complete the board by time $\omega^2$, which means he has $\omega$ many limits at which he must go first, and he will use these to ensure that the board becomes filled in some systematic manner, while on the rest of the moves trying to undertake a version of the copying strategy we described for the second player. At any limit before $\omega^2$, there will have been only finitely many extraneous limit moves, and so we might hope that they&#8217;ve been fairly harmless. And then the copying strategy will rule out row, column and diagonal wins for the opponent. I don&#8217;t quite see all the details, but perhaps something like this can work.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I think the argument is right, and I have written about it in the main post.</p>
<p>The strategy doesn&#8217;t seem, however, to prevent a column win for the first player, but rather ensures that any such winning configuration is duplicated for the second player, forcing the draw. If the first player always plays on one of the paired columns, and you copy on the other, then both will make the winning configuration. </p>
<p>Incidentally, I think you probably mean $3m+1$, $3m+2$, instead of $2m+1$, etc. I&#8217;m not sure if users can edit comments here, but if you are not able to edit, I think I can change this for you. </p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think it would be nice to let the second player start a series of omega moves sometimes, to make the game more symmetric. I would write the move index in the Cantor normal form, and player 1 moves iff the sum of the coefficients is even.</p>
<p>Maybe the players can force draw already when it is sufficient to arrange k number of coins in a row, where k is finite? If the board is Z^2 without gravity and the winning configuration is a 2&#215;2 square, there is an easy proof that both players can force a draw (arrange cells in pairs like bricks, if the first player plays X, the second player plays its pair). Similarly, if the winning configuration is a vertical or horizontal line of five. I think this is also the case for a vertical or horizontal or diagonal line for some k, but I do not remember the details. With gravity it could be similar.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey Jeff! How nice to have a comment from you. </p>
<p>I agree about your remark. Since there are only countably many different winning &#8220;reasons&#8221;, one can impose a priority on them and use this to break ties. For example, we could say that it is better to start your row, column or diagonal closer to the origin, or if the same distance, then rows are better than columns are better than diagonals.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much for this. I want to digest it further, but one issue to address at the start is that to win with a row, you don&#8217;t need the whole row, but only a final segment&#8212;a connected $\omega$-length piece of it. So you have to pay attention to blocking the rows beneath your target diagonal. </p>
<p>But I think your blocking squares and mod 3 ideas are very good. Let me think more about it.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let me try to flesh out what I was saying (with no guarantee of success). I want, as the second player, to stop you, as first player, from winning outright. So as above, after your first move I shall nominate a diagonal that I promise to occupy in its entirety. </p>
<p>That means you won&#8217;t get a full row, and it will be easy for me to stop you getting one of the first few columns, so it remains for me to ensure that you don&#8217;t get any diagonals that are lower than my target diagonal, apart from the one directly below.</p>
<p>To do this, I choose a fairly sparse set of points such that each of those lower diagonals contains at least one of those points, and there is only one point in each column. And I&#8217;ll make sure that each point from that set is at even height and is a lot lower than the target diagonal. Let&#8217;s call these blocking points.</p>
<p>I will now apply the following strategy. Every time you play in a column below a blocking point, I will immediately play directly above you. That guarantees that I will get all blocking points, unless I am forced at some point to play directly above myself, before having reached the blocking point. Let&#8217;s call a column safe if I&#8217;m allowed to play there. Then if all columns are unsafe, there must be a first moment when that happened, and that can&#8217;t be at a successor ordinal because then there is a safe column somewhere and that takes infinitely many moves to fill up. So it&#8217;s at a limit ordinal, which means that you have to make the next move at that danger moment for me. </p>
<p>So I think I can get all the blocking points.</p>
<p>Ah but that doesn&#8217;t quite work, since if you fill up all columns apart from two that contain two blocking points for which the parities of the distances from the target diagonal are different, then you will end up occupying a point in my target diagonal if I apply the strategy.</p>
<p>But I think I can at least stop you winning, by applying the same proof but to a set of points that blocks all rows, all columns and all diagonals. I think all I need is that all the blocking points in any column have even parity. </p>
<p>OK here&#8217;s a quick version of the argument. I nominate an infinite set of columns where you will be the first to play and where the play thereafter will alternate between us (because whenever you play there I will go straight on top). Assuming I succeed, and choose the columns sensibly, I can rule out all diagonals this way, as well as all rows of even height. </p>
<p>In fact, let me be a bit more concrete. My strategy is as follows. If you play in a column with x-coordinate zero mod 3, then I&#8217;ll play on top of you immediately afterwards. If you play in column with x-coordinate 2m+1, then the first time you do so I&#8217;ll play in the column 2m+2, and vice versa. Otherwise, whenever you play in one of those columns I&#8217;ll play on top immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>I claim that at the end of the game, all the 0-mod-3 columns will be filled you-me-you-me-you-me etc., and for each m, at least one of the 2m+1 and the 2m+2 columns will be filled me-you-me-you etc.  (that one being the one you didn&#8217;t go in first), while the other will alternate either straight away or after starting you-you. Note that this stops you occupying any row, column or diagonal.</p>
<p>If I fail in that objective, there will have to be a first moment when I fail. It can&#8217;t be at a successor ordinal, since all I have to do is stick to that strategy. And at a limit ordinal your options are to play above one of my pieces, in which case I can happily continue, or to occupy an unoccupied column. If the unoccupied column is 0-mod-3 I&#8217;m happy, and if it&#8217;s 1 or 2, then the other must also be unoccupied (or I would have contributed to the first one) so again I&#8217;m happy.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much for this. I had come to essentially the same idea while walking to college this morning. It seems very difficult to set up your diagonal in a way that doesn&#8217;t also allow the opponent to build a diagonal at the same time.</p>
<p>I think your final conclusion is not quite right, since it could be that the opponent has already won at an earlier stage, before you get set up to complete your diagonal. That is, couldn&#8217;t it be that before the penultimate points are played below the diagonal at which you are aimed, that your opponent has already won? (And yes, if both players succeed in building a row, column or diagonal, then it is a draw.) </p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t clear to me whether we should look upon going first at limits as an advantage or a disadvantage. </p>
<p>I would be very intrigued if it came out that one of the players could have a winning strategy. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, one way to imagine arguing against this would be to diagonalize against all possible rows, columns and diagonals. There are only countably many ways to win, and any of them can be spoiled by a single well-placed coin. The rows and columns can be each easily refuted in finitely many moves each. For the diagonals, one wants to try to refute a given diagonal, perhaps in the way you describe, but one cannot allow that the play proceeds transfinitely, for then perhaps there is a win on another lower diagonal. Perhaps one can try to kill all the diagonals in such a way that if one doesn&#8217;t get a chance to kill a given diagonal, then it doesn&#8217;t matter, because it means that play hadn&#8217;t proceeded far enough for it to need to be killed.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Regarding <q>Moving around every few years for postdocs would be exhausting</q>, I wholeheartedly agree! Every such decision has pros and cons. They are usually not obvious at the outset.

The lesson I learned though my own course is that every decision is right, at least at the time you make it, and there is never any point regretting it later on&#8230; Just keep on doing what you do best all the time!</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I once gave a talk at a gathering of high school students competing in a math olympics contest, and the main thesis I wanted to prove to them was:  It is very likely that rare events occur. We discussed the odds of a particular pattern of outcome when flipping a coin six times.  Any particular pattern, we all agreed, was remote, occurring with probability 1/64.  And then on the stage I actually flipped the coin six times.  But it was manifest that we would get *some* pattern, so I had proved my point, that it was very likely that a rare event occurs. </p>
<p>We went on to look at the paradoxical situations that arise when someone gets a positive test result for a rare disease.  Should they be worried?  If the test is 99% accurate, but the disease occurs in say, 1 in million, then a positive result is not so worrisome: in  million people, there will be about 1 true positive result, and about 10,000 false positives, since 1% of a million is 10,000. So the odds that you&#8217;ve actually got the disease, given that you tested positive, is 1 in 10,000. </p>
<p>But your situation is completely different!  It would be as though we had calculated the odds of getting HHHTTT, and then when I actually flipped the coin on stage, i actually got the same pattern HHHTTT. Totally weird!  And very unlikely.  But you know, if it wasn&#8217;t that, it would have been some other totally unlikely thing, like getting all green lights, or all red lights, or getting the serial number 123456 on your receipt at Starbucks.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the comment. I do want to point out that I have the copyright to all my papers on the arXiv.  I don&#8217;t know whether any papers there are in the public domain, but the default license grants the arXiv just enough rights to publish the paper, while reserving all other rights for the author. The arXiv, for mathematics, does resolve many issues with peer review, from the delay in dissemination to the cost of paywalls. This, and the practice of speaking about results immediately, long before formal publication, makes the peer review system in mathematics essentially a secondary mechanism for establishing credentials, rather than the primary mechanism for publishing. Unfortunately, there are many scientific disciplines that have nothing analogous to the arXiv, and which do not tend to publicize results before formal publication. The situation in those areas is very different.</p>]]></summary>
