        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am wondering whether we might be able to make a drawing strategy for the first player using a similar idea. My proposal is that player one will aim to complete the board by time $\omega^2$, which means he has $\omega$ many limits at which he must go first, and he will use these to ensure that the board becomes filled in some systematic manner, while on the rest of the moves trying to undertake a version of the copying strategy we described for the second player. At any limit before $\omega^2$, there will have been only finitely many extraneous limit moves, and so we might hope that they&#8217;ve been fairly harmless. And then the copying strategy will rule out row, column and diagonal wins for the opponent. I don&#8217;t quite see all the details, but perhaps something like this can work.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I think the argument is right, and I have written about it in the main post.</p>
<p>The strategy doesn&#8217;t seem, however, to prevent a column win for the first player, but rather ensures that any such winning configuration is duplicated for the second player, forcing the draw. If the first player always plays on one of the paired columns, and you copy on the other, then both will make the winning configuration. </p>
<p>Incidentally, I think you probably mean $3m+1$, $3m+2$, instead of $2m+1$, etc. I&#8217;m not sure if users can edit comments here, but if you are not able to edit, I think I can change this for you. </p>]]></summary>

At the moment I don&#8217;t see any way for the second player to win or for the first player to stop the second player winning, so the question is still interesting!</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think it would be nice to let the second player start a series of omega moves sometimes, to make the game more symmetric. I would write the move index in the Cantor normal form, and player 1 moves iff the sum of the coefficients is even.</p>
<p>Maybe the players can force draw already when it is sufficient to arrange k number of coins in a row, where k is finite? If the board is Z^2 without gravity and the winning configuration is a 2&#215;2 square, there is an easy proof that both players can force a draw (arrange cells in pairs like bricks, if the first player plays X, the second player plays its pair). Similarly, if the winning configuration is a vertical or horizontal line of five. I think this is also the case for a vertical or horizontal or diagonal line for some k, but I do not remember the details. With gravity it could be similar.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey Jeff! How nice to have a comment from you. </p>
<p>I agree about your remark. Since there are only countably many different winning &#8220;reasons&#8221;, one can impose a priority on them and use this to break ties. For example, we could say that it is better to start your row, column or diagonal closer to the origin, or if the same distance, then rows are better than columns are better than diagonals.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much for this. I want to digest it further, but one issue to address at the start is that to win with a row, you don&#8217;t need the whole row, but only a final segment&#8212;a connected $\omega$-length piece of it. So you have to pay attention to blocking the rows beneath your target diagonal. </p>
<p>But I think your blocking squares and mod 3 ideas are very good. Let me think more about it.</p>]]></summary>

His union ultrafilters paper from 1987 has a few comments on quantifiers, his 1993 introductory paper definitely has some treatment (and in my thesis, the definition of idempotent filters comes down to his supervision). </p>

<p>Regarding <q>Moving around every few years for postdocs would be exhausting</q>, I wholeheartedly agree! Every such decision has pros and cons. They are usually not obvious at the outset. Moreover, they change over time. The lesson I learned though my own course is that every decision is right, at least at the time you make it, and there is never any point regretting it later on&#8230; Just keep on doing what you do best all the time!</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I once gave a talk at a gathering of high school students competing in a math olympics contest, and the main thesis I wanted to prove to them was:  It is very likely that rare events occur. We discussed the odds of a particular pattern of outcome when flipping a coin six times.  Any particular pattern, we all agreed, was remote, occurring with probability 1/64.  And then on the stage I actually flipped the coin six times.  But it was manifest that we would get *some* pattern, so I had proved my point, that it was very likely that a rare event occurs. </p>
<p>We went on to look at the paradoxical situations that arise when someone gets a positive test result for a rare disease.  Should they be worried?  If the test is 99% accurate, but the disease occurs in say, 1 in million, then a positive result is not so worrisome: in  million people, there will be about 1 true positive result, and about 10,000 false positives, since 1% of a million is 10,000. So the odds that you&#8217;ve actually got the disease, given that you tested positive, is 1 in 10,000. </p>
<p>But your situation is completely different!  It would be as though we had calculated the odds of getting HHHTTT, and then when I actually flipped the coin on stage, i actually got the same pattern HHHTTT. Totally weird!  And very unlikely.  But you know, if it wasn&#8217;t that, it would have been some other totally unlikely thing, like getting all green lights, or all red lights, or getting the serial number 123456 on your receipt at Starbucks.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the comment. I do want to point out that I have the copyright to all my papers on the arXiv.  I don&#8217;t know whether any papers there are in the public domain, but the default license grants the arXiv just enough rights to publish the paper, while reserving all other rights for the author. The arXiv, for mathematics, does resolve many issues with peer review, from the delay in dissemination to the cost of paywalls. This, and the practice of speaking about results immediately, long before formal publication, makes the peer review system in mathematics essentially a secondary mechanism for establishing credentials, rather than the primary mechanism for publishing. Unfortunately, there are many scientific disciplines that have nothing analogous to the arXiv, and which do not tend to publicize results before formal publication. The situation in those areas is very different.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think there is no doubt the peer-review process is corrupted: I&#8217;m sure I am not the only one who has seen reviewers with motives/agendas reject work worthy of being published. I&#8217;ve always thought the problem WAS peer-review, so why not just abolish it? Personally, I think ArXiv is the solution to this problem. It is free, there is no copyright, and people can make up their own minds as to whether or not they think it is good.</p>]]></summary>
