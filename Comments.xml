        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Athar, thanks very much for this. It seems to me that this way of arguing in part amounts to replacing the Keisler-Morley theorem in my argument with the omitting types theorem. That isn&#8217;t too suprising, I suppose, since one can prove the Keisler-Morley theorem by omitting types. But your argument also unifies nicely with the rest of the argument, and so I think it is very nice. I am wondering whether this way of thinking can simply the proof of the universal $\Sigma_1$-definable sequence? The current argument is based on this proof of the Barwise extension theorem, and perhaps we can simplify it via omitting types. I want to think that through. </p>]]></summary>

<p>To flesh out my comment from your Q&amp;A session, given a countable M, consider the theory T consisting of the atomic diagram of M, together with ZFC + V = L. You proved that this theory is (finitely) consistent in your &#8220;nonstandard&#8221; case (note that in this proof, we do not need to assume that M is omega nonstandard). So by the omitting types theorem, there is a model N of T such that N is an end extension of M.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I think we basically agree. I suppose one can say that I have over-stated the case to a certain extent, since it isn&#8217;t actually completely clear from Turing&#8217;s article whether he thought of it just like this. After all, at least on the surface, he does define a computable real number as a kind of real number. But then when one gets into how one might use these, the real number gets replaced by the program. </p>
<p>So in my treatment of this issue in the book I am currently writing on the philosophy of mathematics, I take a somewhat softer tone, while making essentially the same points.</p>
<p>I find these issues quite subtle and interesting, for both mathematical and philosophical reasons.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think that it is the idea that there are definitions of a term by a different coextensional one that are not *correct* that I was at pains to deny. There are of course interesting questions about how a certain notion and theory are best formalised/analysed when we are not sure at the outset about what sort of entities we want to talk about (reals or programs?). What I got wrong, as Prof. Hamkins pointed out, is that I assumed that the definition had to single out a class of real numbers. But then, on Turing&#8217;s initial definition and on the modern one define, the computable numbers are two different, in fact disjoint classes of programs. They are not coextensional at all. Therefore, again, this does not provide an example of two definitions that are extensionally equivalent but of which one is incorrect.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for posting this very interesting piece; it is a fascinating topic and your explanation of it was (as usual) very clear and accessible. I think itÂ is a philosophically interesting fact that two definitions can be extensionally equivalent but not equally &#8216;correct&#8217; or &#8216;good&#8217; mathematically speaking. There might be many different kinds of reason why one of a pair of equivalent definitions is preferable to the other. One might be more explanatory, or better support generalisations, or provide a better foundation for a certain kind of theory and so on; it would be interesting to consider further examples and try to classify them.</p>
<p>As a footnote, I think it&#8217;s worth mentioning that Turing himself came to realise that the binary digit representation of real numbers he used in &#8216;On Computable Numbers&#8217; was problematic. He discusses this in &#8216;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem. A Correction&#8217; (Proc. London Math. Soc. 43 (1937), 544-6; also reprinted in Jack Copeland (ed) &#8216;The essential Turing&#8217; pp. 94-96).</p>
<p>Turing&#8217;s discussion of the problem (and his solution to it) in this paper is very brief and somewhat cryptic. There is an excellent, detailed discussion of it in Guido Gherardi, &#8216;Alan Turing and the Foundations of Computable Analysis&#8217; , Bulletin of Symbolic Logic 17(3) 2011, 394-430.</p>
<p>In the &#8216;correction&#8217; article, Turing does not discuss the problem you described, that the basic operations on real numbers cannot be represented as computable functions when the binary digit representation is used. Instead he discusses the following problem: although we might have a program P that computes a sequence of rational approximations to a real number <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;alpha" title="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> (which we can prove must be computable) there is no program which takes as input programs like P and produces as output a program that enumerates the binary digits of <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;alpha" title="&#92;alpha" class="latex" />.Â There must *be* some program that enumerates the digits of <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;alpha" title="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> but there&#8217;s no general way of constructing it from a program that computes the sequence of rational approximations. (So the situation seems at least analogous to the problem that there is no program to compute the digits of a + b from programs that enumerate the digits of a and of b).</p>
<p>Turing writes &#8220;This disagreeable situation can be avoided by modifying the manner in which computable numbers are associated with computable sequences, the totality of computable numbers being left unaltered.&#8221; In other words,Â he offers an alternative definition of &#8216;computable number&#8217; which avoids this problem but which is equivalent to the orginal definition in the sense that a real number is computable in the original sense if and only if it is computable in this new sense &#8211; just as described in your piece. The alternative definition he suggests is not, I believe, the same as any currently standard definition, but is equally workable. He considers sequences of 0s and 1s of the form:</p>
<p><img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="i" title="i" class="latex" /> (0 or 1) followed by 1 repeated <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="n" title="n" class="latex" /> times followed by a 0 followed by a sequence <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="c_1" title="c_1" class="latex" /> <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="c_2" title="c_2" class="latex" /> <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="c_3" title="c_3" class="latex" /> <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_4+%5Cldots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="c_4 &#92;ldots" title="c_4 &#92;ldots" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and associates with each such sequence the real number</p>
<p><img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282i+-+1%29n+%2B+%5Csum_%7Br%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%282c_r+-1%29%282%2F3%29%5Er&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="(2i - 1)n + &#92;sum_{r=1}^{&#92;infty}(2c_r -1)(2/3)^r" title="(2i - 1)n + &#92;sum_{r=1}^{&#92;infty}(2c_r -1)(2/3)^r" class="latex" /></p>
<p>So for example the sequence 10 1 corresponds to 2/3, 10 0 corresponds to -2/3, 1110 01 corresponds to 2 + 4/9, 10 11111&#8230; corresponds to 2/3 + 4/9 + 8/27 + &#8230; = 2 and so on.</p>
<p>A Turing machine that prints a sequence of 1s and 0s of this form is then said to compute the corresponding real number; a real number is computable if there is a machine that computes it. Turing cites Brouwer as the source for &#8220;this use of overlapping intervals for the definition of real numbers&#8221;. (See Gherardi section 3.3 for discussion of this).</p>
<p>Turing states (but does not prove) that this new definition solves the problem he discussed. Gherardi proves (section 3.4) that Turing&#8217;s representation is *computably equivalent* to one of the current standard representations (the Cauchy representation) and so it also solves the problem described in your piece &#8211; the standard operations of addition, multiplication and so on are now computable functions.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t agree fully with this comment, and I still think it is correct to say that Turing has the wrong definition. </p>
<p>The reason is that we do not ultimately think of a computable real number as a particular kind of real number, and despite his initial definition, neither does Turing. When it comes to defining operations on the computable real numbers, which is what Turing is aiming at, he explicitly abandons the idea that these are defined on the real numbers themselves or some of them. Rather, operations on the computable real numbers are functions defined on the programs that generate such reals. So a computable real number, for Turing as well as for the contemporary theory, is a program for generating a real number.</p>
<p>And if one adopts Turing&#8217;s view that the programs we should be looking at are the programs that generate the successive digits of the real number, then this is precisely where he goes wrong, since in this case, the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication will not be computable, for the reasons I explained in the post. </p>
<p>Turing seems in his article to assume that they would be computable, and much more, since he is using the tangent function and infinite sums and so on. </p>
<p>The philosophical question here as I see it is: what does it mean to have a computable real number? Does it mean to have a particular real number? No, it means to have an algorithm that is capable of describing a real number.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I once gave a talk at a gathering of high school students competing in a math olympics contest, and the main thesis I wanted to prove to them was:  It is very likely that rare events occur. We discussed the odds of a particular pattern of outcome when flipping a coin six times.  Any particular pattern, we all agreed, was remote, occurring with probability 1/64.  And then on the stage I actually flipped the coin six times.  But it was manifest that we would get *some* pattern, so I had proved my point, that it was very likely that a rare event occurs. </p>
<p>We went on to look at the paradoxical situations that arise when someone gets a positive test result for a rare disease.  Should they be worried?  If the test is 99% accurate, but the disease occurs in say, 1 in million, then a positive result is not so worrisome: in  million people, there will be about 1 true positive result, and about 10,000 false positives, since 1% of a million is 10,000. So the odds that you&#8217;ve actually got the disease, given that you tested positive, is 1 in 10,000. </p>
<p>But your situation is completely different!  It would be as though we had calculated the odds of getting HHHTTT, and then when I actually flipped the coin on stage, i actually got the same pattern HHHTTT. Totally weird!  And very unlikely.  But you know, if it wasn&#8217;t that, it would have been some other totally unlikely thing, like getting all green lights, or all red lights, or getting the serial number 123456 on your receipt at Starbucks.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the comment. I do want to point out that I have the copyright to all my papers on the arXiv.  I don&#8217;t know whether any papers there are in the public domain, but the default license grants the arXiv just enough rights to publish the paper, while reserving all other rights for the author. The arXiv, for mathematics, does resolve many issues with peer review, from the delay in dissemination to the cost of paywalls. This, and the practice of speaking about results immediately, long before formal publication, makes the peer review system in mathematics essentially a secondary mechanism for establishing credentials, rather than the primary mechanism for publishing. Unfortunately, there are many scientific disciplines that have nothing analogous to the arXiv, and which do not tend to publicize results before formal publication. The situation in those areas is very different.</p>]]></summary>
