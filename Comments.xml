LM was further investigated in a 2004 paper of mine, which includes a proof that LM is equivalent to the global form of the Kinna-Wagner selection principle in set theory. On the other hand, one can formulate a strong negation of Leibniz’s principle by first adding a unary predicate I(x) to the usual language of set theory, and then augmenting ZF with a scheme that ensures that I(x) describes a proper class of indiscernibles, thus giving rise to an extension ZFI of ZF that I showed (2005) to be intimately related to Mahlo cardinals of finite order. In this talk I will give an expository account of the above and related results that attest to a lively interaction between set theory and Leibniz’s principle of identity of indiscernibles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[&#8230;] Oxford Set Theory SeminarTime:&nbsp;Wednesday, May 20, 4pm UK timeSpeaker: Joel David Hamkins, OXFORDTitle: Bi-interpretation of weak set theoriesAbstract: Set theory exhibits a truly robust mutual interpretability phenomenon: in any model of one set theory we can define models of diverse other set theories and vice versa. In any model of ZFC, we can define models of ZFC + GCH and also of ZFC + ¬CH and so on in hundreds of cases. And yet, it turns out, in no instance do these mutual interpretations rise to the level of bi-interpretation. Ali Enayat proved that distinct theories extending ZF are never bi-interpretable, and models of ZF are bi-interpretable only when they are isomorphic. So there is no nontrivial bi-interpretation phenomenon in set theory at the level of ZF or above.&nbsp; Nevertheless, for natural weaker set theories, we prove, including ZFC- without power set and Zermelo set theory Z, there are nontrivial instances of bi-interpretation. Specifically, there are well-founded models of ZFC- that are bi-interpretable, but not isomorphic—even (H(omega_1),in) and (H(omega_2),in) can be bi-interpretable—and there are distinct bi-interpretable theories extending ZFC-. Similarly, using a construction of Mathias, we prove that every model of ZF is bi-interpretable with a model of Zermelo set theory in which the replacement axiom fails. This is joint work with Alfredo Roque Freire.Information:&nbsp;The seminar will take place virtually. Please email Samuel Adam-Day (me@samadamday.com) for the meeting id. [&#8230;]</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[&#8230;] The point is that if $M$ is a non-$omega$-model of $mathsf{ZFC}$, then there will be things in $M$ which $M$ thinks are first-order sentences but which actually aren&#8217;t (intuitively, they&#8217;re secretly infinitely long). This added level of flexibility changes the situation dramatically: a negative answer to the broader question was established by Hamkins and Yang. [&#8230;]</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think I must be misunderstanding something, because I don&#8217;t see how the cases work in the neighborhood of 200 pirates. You say that it&#8217;s only when we get to 199 pirates that the proposing pirate must spend all available coins to buy off the other pirates and be left with nothing themselves, but extrapolating from the table above it certainly seems like this should occur with only 198 pirates: the third pirate gets 2 coins and each even-numbered pirate before the 198th gets 1 coin, leaving no coins for the 198th pirate.</p>
<p>But then it should be possible for the 199th pirate to get away with claiming a coin for themselves: all they have to do is offer to take 1 coin themselves and give 1 coin to every other odd-numbered pirate except the 3rd, plus 1 coin to the 198th pirate. The 199th pirate gets their own vote, 98 votes from other odd-numbered pirates who would otherwise get nothing, and 1 vote from the 198th pirate, who again would otherwise be left with nothing. This means the 200th pirate would not have any valid proposal, since with the gold supply available they could not out-compete the offer of 1 coin to each of 100 pirates. Then the 201st pirate can again make off with a coin of their own by offering 1 coin to the 3rd pirate and to each even-numbered pirate up through the 196th, keeping 1 coin for themselves, thereby gaining: their own vote, the votes of pirate 3 and the 98 even-numbered pirates up through 196 (who would all otherwise get nothing), and the vote of the 200th pirate (who would otherwise die). Only after this does it seem to settle down into the pattern where there are successively longer chains of pirates with no possible survival strategy interrupted by single pirates who can survive (albeit without any gold) by getting their successors&#8217; support for free.</p>
<p>Am I falling into an off-by-one error here somewhere?</p>]]></summary>

In contrast, smaller large cardinals, such as weakly compact and Ramsey cardinals, are usually characterized by their combinatorial properties such as existence of large homogeneous sets for colorings. It turns out that many familiar smaller large cardinals have elegant elementary embedding characterizations. The embeddings here are correspondingly ‘small’; they are between transitive set models of set theory, usually the size of the large cardinal in question. The study of these elementary embeddings has led us to isolate certain important properties via which we have defined robust hierarchies of large cardinals below a measurable cardinal. In this talk, I will introduce these types of elementary embeddings and discuss the large cardinal hierarchies that have come out of the analysis of their properties. The more recent results in this area are a joint work with Philipp Schlicht.Information: For the Zoom access code, contact Samuel Adam-Day: <a href="mailto:me@samadamday.com">me@samadamday.com</a>.

<p>Regarding <q>Moving around every few years for postdocs would be exhausting</q>, I wholeheartedly agree! Every such decision has pros and cons. They are usually not obvious at the outset.

The lesson I learned though my own course is that every decision is right, at least at the time you make it, and there is never any point regretting it later on&#8230; Just keep on doing what you do best all the time!</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I once gave a talk at a gathering of high school students competing in a math olympics contest, and the main thesis I wanted to prove to them was:  It is very likely that rare events occur. We discussed the odds of a particular pattern of outcome when flipping a coin six times.  Any particular pattern, we all agreed, was remote, occurring with probability 1/64.  And then on the stage I actually flipped the coin six times.  But it was manifest that we would get *some* pattern, so I had proved my point, that it was very likely that a rare event occurs. </p>
<p>We went on to look at the paradoxical situations that arise when someone gets a positive test result for a rare disease.  Should they be worried?  If the test is 99% accurate, but the disease occurs in say, 1 in million, then a positive result is not so worrisome: in  million people, there will be about 1 true positive result, and about 10,000 false positives, since 1% of a million is 10,000. So the odds that you&#8217;ve actually got the disease, given that you tested positive, is 1 in 10,000. </p>
<p>But your situation is completely different!  It would be as though we had calculated the odds of getting HHHTTT, and then when I actually flipped the coin on stage, i actually got the same pattern HHHTTT. Totally weird!  And very unlikely.  But you know, if it wasn&#8217;t that, it would have been some other totally unlikely thing, like getting all green lights, or all red lights, or getting the serial number 123456 on your receipt at Starbucks.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Thanks for the comment. I do want to point out that I have the copyright to all my papers on the arXiv.  I don&#8217;t know whether any papers there are in the public domain, but the default license grants the arXiv just enough rights to publish the paper, while reserving all other rights for the author. The arXiv, for mathematics, does resolve many issues with peer review, from the delay in dissemination to the cost of paywalls. This, and the practice of speaking about results immediately, long before formal publication, makes the peer review system in mathematics essentially a secondary mechanism for establishing credentials, rather than the primary mechanism for publishing. Unfortunately, there are many scientific disciplines that have nothing analogous to the arXiv, and which do not tend to publicize results before formal publication. The situation in those areas is very different.</p>]]></summary>
