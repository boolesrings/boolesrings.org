<p>Hi David! Let us demonstrate that $\omega_2\nrightarrow(\omega_2,\text{closed}(\omega_1+1))^2$.<br />
For every limit ordinal $\beta&lt;\omega_2$, fix a club $D_\beta$ in $\beta$ of order-type $cf(\beta)$,<br />
and then pick a coloring $c:[\omega_2]^2\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ such that, for every limit ordinal $\beta&lt;\omega_2$, and every $\alpha<\beta$, $c(\alpha,\beta)=0$ iff $\alpha\in D_\beta$.

	

<li>$\blacktriangleright$ For every cofinal subset $S$ of $\omega_2$, we may find some $\beta\in S$ such that $S\cap\beta$ has order-type $>\omega_1$, and hence, there is $\alpha\in S\setminus D_\beta$, so that $c(\alpha,\beta)=1$.</li>
<li>$\blacktriangleright$ For every club $C$ in an ordinal $\beta$ of uncountable cofinality, we may find $\alpha\in C\cap D_\beta$, so that $c(\alpha,\beta)=0$.</li>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nice talk, I haven&#8217;t read the papers carefully but the slides are a good summary.  I didn&#8217;t realize the &#8220;white wins&#8221; question had unknown and possibly very high (hyperarithmetic etc.) complexity.  What I had wondered was whether it was possible to encode an arbitrary arithmetic sentence as an infinite chess position (finite number of pieces on infinite board) such that the sentence is true iff white wins.  Since this is apparently unknown, does it seem likely that the rules of chess could be modified to make it straightforwardly possible, while still looking something like chess?  I think it is philosophically interesting because it gives a way to see sentences with high quantifier complexity as meaningful.  Thanks.</p>]]></summary>

Such models were shown to exist by Kaufmann under the assumption that ♢ holds, and in ZFC by Shelah via an absoluteness argument involving strong logics. They are important in the theory of models of arithmetic notably because they show that many classic results about countable, recursively saturated models of arithmetic cannot be extended to uncountable models. They are also a particularly interesting example of set theoretic incompactness at ω1, similar to an Aronszajn tree.In this talk we’ll look at several set theoretic issues relating to this class of models motivated by the seemingly naïve question of whether or not such models can be killed by forcing without collapsing ω1. Surprisingly the answer to this question turns out to be independent: under MAℵ1 no ω1-preserving forcing can destroy Kaufmann-ness whereas under ♢ there is a Kaufmann model M and a Souslin tree S so that forcing with S adds a satisfaction class to M (thus killing rather classlessness). The techniques involved in these proofs also yield another surprising side of Kaufmann models: it is independent of ZFC whether the class of Kaufmann models can be axiomatized in the logic Lω1,ω(Q) where Q is the quantifier “there exists uncountably many”. This is the logic used in Shelah’s aforementioned result, hence the interest in this level of expressive power.Information: For the Zoom access code, contact Samuel Adam-Day: <a href="mailto:me@samadamday.com">me@samadamday.com</a>.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[&#8230;] Oxford Set Theory SeminarTime: Wednesday, May 27, 4pm UK timeSpeaker: Ali Enayat, GothenbergTitle: Leibnizian and anti-Leibnizian motifs in set theoryAbstract: Leibniz’s principle of identity of indiscernibles at first sight appears completely unrelated to set theory, but Mycielski (1995) formulated a set-theoretic axiom nowadays referred to as LM (for Leibniz-Mycielski) which captures the spirit of Leibniz’s dictum in the following sense: LM holds in a model M of ZF iff M is elementarily equivalent to a model M* in which there is no pair of indiscernibles. LM was further investigated in a 2004 paper of mine, which includes a proof that LM is equivalent to the global form of the Kinna-Wagner selection principle in set theory. On the other hand, one can formulate a strong negation of Leibniz’s principle by first adding a unary predicate I(x) to the usual language of set theory, and then augmenting ZF with a scheme that ensures that I(x) describes a proper class of indiscernibles, thus giving rise to an extension ZFI of ZF that I showed (2005) to be intimately related to Mahlo cardinals of finite order. In this talk I will give an expository account of the above and related results that attest to a lively interaction between set theory and Leibniz’s principle of identity of indiscernibles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I once gave a talk at a gathering of high school students competing in a math olympics contest, and the main thesis I wanted to prove to them was:  It is very likely that rare events occur. We discussed the odds of a particular pattern of outcome when flipping a coin six times.  Any particular pattern, we all agreed, was remote, occurring with probability 1/64.  And then on the stage I actually flipped the coin six times.  But it was manifest that we would get *some* pattern, so I had proved my point, that it was very likely that a rare event occurs. </p>
<p>We went on to look at the paradoxical situations that arise when someone gets a positive test result for a rare disease.  Should they be worried?  If the test is 99% accurate, but the disease occurs in say, 1 in million, then a positive result is not so worrisome: in  million people, there will be about 1 true positive result, and about 10,000 false positives, since 1% of a million is 10,000. So the odds that you&#8217;ve actually got the disease, given that you tested positive, is 1 in 10,000. </p>
<p>But your situation is completely different!  It would be as though we had calculated the odds of getting HHHTTT, and then when I actually flipped the coin on stage, i actually got the same pattern HHHTTT. Totally weird!  And very unlikely.  But you know, if it wasn&#8217;t that, it would have been some other totally unlikely thing, like getting all green lights, or all red lights, or getting the serial number 123456 on your receipt at Starbucks.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Thanks for the comment. I do want to point out that I have the copyright to all my papers on the arXiv.  I don&#8217;t know whether any papers there are in the public domain, but the default license grants the arXiv just enough rights to publish the paper, while reserving all other rights for the author. The arXiv, for mathematics, does resolve many issues with peer review, from the delay in dissemination to the cost of paywalls. This, and the practice of speaking about results immediately, long before formal publication, makes the peer review system in mathematics essentially a secondary mechanism for establishing credentials, rather than the primary mechanism for publishing. Unfortunately, there are many scientific disciplines that have nothing analogous to the arXiv, and which do not tend to publicize results before formal publication. The situation in those areas is very different.</p>]]></summary>
