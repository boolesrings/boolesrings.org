        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>July 17th isn&#8217;t one of the allowed birthdays, so the situation you&#8217;re describing isn&#8217;t possible.  Cheryl had given the actual month to Albert and the actual date number to Bernard, and it is known to be one of the dates on the list. And if you had meant that Albert had been given August and Bernard 17, so the birthday would be August 17th, then although the first two statements would be right, nevertheless Albert&#8217;s final remarks would not be right, and so this date doesn&#8217;t fulfill the puzzle. </p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m glad your daughter enjoyed the first one. To my way of thinking, the main puzzle of the Euler characteristic is why it should always be 2? Why is that? The puzzle is to figure out why it is always the same. But a secondary puzzle is to look into the three-dimensional cases, and to figure out how to count faces etc. in that case.</p>]]></summary>

However, graph theory for eight years old did not impress her.  She said, &#8220;O, its 2.  Than what?&#8221;  There was no puzzle in it like Konigsberg bridge problem.

In this case, we have s = s \cup t, hence |s \cup t| = n-1, so the condition on the left side is not satisfied.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Could you explain your reasons? I think my slides and paper are correct, and that your proposed change would be wrong. The point is that (s union t) has size at least n, just in case there is a way of allocating the three parts of the Venn diagram with i,j,k so as to realize the three clauses. Certainly, if the right-hand side holds as I&#8217;ve described it, then of course, (s union t) will have at least size n, and conversely, if s union t has size at least n, then there will be some i+j+k=n realizing the desired pattern. </p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t regard this as a &#8220;typo&#8221;. But perhaps I&#8217;m missing something?</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, I have corrected the link; thanks very much for that.)</p>]]></summary>

<p>Regarding <q>Moving around every few years for postdocs would be exhausting</q>, I wholeheartedly agree! Every such decision has pros and cons. They are usually not obvious at the outset. Moreover, they change over time. The lesson I learned though my own course is that every decision is right, at least at the time you make it, and there is never any point regretting it later on&#8230; Just keep on doing what you do best all the time!</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I once gave a talk at a gathering of high school students competing in a math olympics contest, and the main thesis I wanted to prove to them was:  It is very likely that rare events occur. We discussed the odds of a particular pattern of outcome when flipping a coin six times.  Any particular pattern, we all agreed, was remote, occurring with probability 1/64.  And then on the stage I actually flipped the coin six times.  But it was manifest that we would get *some* pattern, so I had proved my point, that it was very likely that a rare event occurs. </p>
<p>We went on to look at the paradoxical situations that arise when someone gets a positive test result for a rare disease.  Should they be worried?  If the test is 99% accurate, but the disease occurs in say, 1 in million, then a positive result is not so worrisome: in  million people, there will be about 1 true positive result, and about 10,000 false positives, since 1% of a million is 10,000. So the odds that you&#8217;ve actually got the disease, given that you tested positive, is 1 in 10,000. </p>
<p>But your situation is completely different!  It would be as though we had calculated the odds of getting HHHTTT, and then when I actually flipped the coin on stage, i actually got the same pattern HHHTTT. Totally weird!  And very unlikely.  But you know, if it wasn&#8217;t that, it would have been some other totally unlikely thing, like getting all green lights, or all red lights, or getting the serial number 123456 on your receipt at Starbucks.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the comment. I do want to point out that I have the copyright to all my papers on the arXiv.  I don&#8217;t know whether any papers there are in the public domain, but the default license grants the arXiv just enough rights to publish the paper, while reserving all other rights for the author. The arXiv, for mathematics, does resolve many issues with peer review, from the delay in dissemination to the cost of paywalls. This, and the practice of speaking about results immediately, long before formal publication, makes the peer review system in mathematics essentially a secondary mechanism for establishing credentials, rather than the primary mechanism for publishing. Unfortunately, there are many scientific disciplines that have nothing analogous to the arXiv, and which do not tend to publicize results before formal publication. The situation in those areas is very different.</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think there is no doubt the peer-review process is corrupted: I&#8217;m sure I am not the only one who has seen reviewers with motives/agendas reject work worthy of being published. I&#8217;ve always thought the problem WAS peer-review, so why not just abolish it? Personally, I think ArXiv is the solution to this problem. It is free, there is no copyright, and people can make up their own minds as to whether or not they think it is good.</p>]]></summary>
