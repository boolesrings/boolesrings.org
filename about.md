> a place for researchers to connect with one another

> a place for researchers to share our work and experiences

## A test case for the modern researcher home page

Currently, most researchers use their academic homepages for little more than to display contact information and publication lists. We believe it is our responsibility to take charge of our online presence, especially the academic side of it.

Modern web technologies allow us to create our own site and connect with others without joining a centralized social network such as Facebook or Researchgate. On Boolesâ€™ Rings we experiment and share best practices towards such a network of homepages.

## Developers

boolesrings.org was founded by Samuel Coskey and Peter Krautzberger using Wordpress. At present the site is decentralized, which means many members host their own site in any way they choose.
